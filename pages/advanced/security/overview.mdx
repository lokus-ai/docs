# Security Overview

Comprehensive guide to Lokus security architecture, principles, and threat mitigation strategies.

**Version:** 1.3.1 | **Status:** Production Ready

## What's New in v1.3

**OAuth 2.0 + PKCE**
Production-ready OAuth 2.0 implementation with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security. Prevents authorization code interception attacks and eliminates need for client secrets in native apps.

**Platform-Native Token Storage**
Secure credential storage using macOS Keychain and Windows Credential Manager. Tokens encrypted at rest with OS-level security.

**Hybrid Redirect Flow**
Smart redirect handling using deep links with localhost fallback. Seamless OAuth experience across platforms.

**Automatic Token Refresh**
Background token renewal without user intervention. Maintains session continuity with exponential backoff retry logic.

## Security Architecture

Lokus implements defense-in-depth security with multiple layers of protection:

1. **File System Sandboxing** - Restricted file access
2. **Plugin Permissions** - Granular permission system
3. **Secure Storage** - Platform-native credential storage
4. **Input Validation** - XSS and injection prevention
5. **Network Security** - HTTPS enforcement, CORS protection
6. **OAuth Security** - Secure authentication flows

> **Note:** 
Security is a shared responsibility. Lokus provides robust security features, but users must follow best practices and keep software updated to maintain a secure environment.

## Threat Model

Understanding potential security threats helps us build better defenses:

### File System Threats

**Directory Traversal Attacks**
- Attackers attempt to access files outside workspace
- Mitigated by path validation and normalization
- Protected against `../../../etc/passwd` patterns

**Symbolic Link Attacks**
- Malicious symlinks pointing to sensitive files
- Prevented by resolving and validating real paths
- Workspace boundary enforcement

**Race Conditions (TOCTOU)**
- Time-of-check to time-of-use vulnerabilities
- Atomic file operations where possible
- File locking mechanisms

### Network Threats

**Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**
- Interception of network traffic
- Mitigated by HTTPS enforcement
- TLS 1.3 for all connections

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- Unauthorized actions on behalf of user
- Protected by state parameter validation
- PKCE code verifier for OAuth flows

**Authorization Code Interception**
- OAuth code stealing attacks
- Prevented by PKCE implementation
- No client secret exposure

### Plugin Threats

**Malicious Plugins**
- Plugins with harmful intent
- Mitigated by permission system
- Sandbox execution environment

**Plugin Vulnerabilities**
- Bugs in trusted plugins
- Memory limits and timeouts
- Regular security audits

---

## File System Security

### Path Validation

All file operations validate paths to prevent directory traversal attacks:

```typescript
function isValidPath(path: string): boolean {
  // Prevent directory traversal
  if (path.includes('..')) {
    return false;
  }

  // Ensure path is within workspace
  const normalizedPath = normalizePath(path);
  const workspacePath = getWorkspacePath();

  return normalizedPath.startsWith(workspacePath);
}
```

> **Note:** 
**Protected Against:**
- `../../../etc/passwd` - Directory traversal
- `file:///etc/passwd` - Absolute paths outside workspace
- Symbolic link attacks
- Race conditions (TOCTOU)


---

### File Type Validation

Lokus validates file types to prevent execution of malicious files:

```typescript
const ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES = [
  '.md', '.txt', '.json',
  '.js', '.ts', '.jsx', '.tsx',
  '.html', '.css', '.yaml', '.toml'
];

function validateFileType(path: string): boolean {
  const ext = path.toLowerCase().match(/\.[^.]+$/)?.[0];
  return ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES.includes(ext);
}
```

**Configure allowed types:**
```json
{
  "security": {
    "allowedFileTypes": [".md", ".txt", ".json"],
    "validateFileTypes": true
  }
}
```

---

### File Size Limits

Prevent denial-of-service attacks from large files:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "maxFileSize": 10485760,
    "maxUploadSize": 5242880
  }
}
```

**Default limits:**
- Max file size: 10MB
- Max upload size: 5MB
- Max workspace size: Unlimited (user discretion)

> **Note:** 
Configure file size limits based on your use case. Lower limits provide better protection against resource exhaustion attacks.


---

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest

**Encrypt sensitive settings:**

```rust
use aes_gcm::{Aes256Gcm, Key, Nonce};
use aes_gcm::aead::{Aead, NewAead};

fn encrypt_data(data: &str, key: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String> {
    let cipher = Aes256Gcm::new(Key::from_slice(key));
    let nonce = Nonce::from_slice(b"unique nonce");

    cipher.encrypt(nonce, data.as_bytes())
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())
}

fn decrypt_data(encrypted: &[u8], key: &[u8]) -> Result<String, String> {
    let cipher = Aes256Gcm::new(Key::from_slice(key));
    let nonce = Nonce::from_slice(b"unique nonce");

    let decrypted = cipher.decrypt(nonce, encrypted)
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;

    String::from_utf8(decrypted)
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())
}
```

---

### Encryption in Transit

All network communication uses TLS 1.3:

```typescript
const agent = new https.Agent({
  minVersion: 'TLSv1.3',
  maxVersion: 'TLSv1.3',
  rejectUnauthorized: true
});

await fetch(url, { agent });
```

---

## Security Auditing

### Logging

Track security-relevant events:

```typescript
class SecurityLogger {
  logAuthAttempt(user: string, success: boolean) {
    console.log(`[AUTH] ${user} - ${success ? 'SUCCESS' : 'FAILURE'}`);
  }

  logFileAccess(plugin: string, path: string, operation: string) {
    console.log(`[FILE] ${plugin} - ${operation} - ${path}`);
  }

  logPermissionDenied(plugin: string, permission: string) {
    console.warn(`[SECURITY] ${plugin} denied ${permission}`);
  }

  logSuspiciousActivity(activity: string, details: any) {
    console.error(`[SECURITY ALERT] ${activity}`, details);
  }
}
```

---

### Monitoring

Detect and respond to security incidents:

```typescript
class SecurityMonitor {
  private failedAttempts = new Map<string, number>();

  recordFailedAuth(user: string) {
    const attempts = this.failedAttempts.get(user) || 0;
    this.failedAttempts.set(user, attempts + 1);

    // Alert after 5 failed attempts
    if (attempts >= 5) {
      this.alertSecurityIncident('Brute force attempt', { user });
    }
  }

  alertSecurityIncident(type: string, details: any) {
    // Send alert notification
    console.error(`SECURITY INCIDENT: ${type}`, details);

    // Could integrate with external monitoring
  }
}
```

      "backups": 365
    }
  }
}
```

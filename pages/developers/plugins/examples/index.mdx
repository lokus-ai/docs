## Using These Examples

### Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new plugin from an example
npm create lokus-plugin@latest my-plugin

# Or manually copy an example
mkdir my-plugin
cd my-plugin
# Copy the code from the example
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Example Features Matrix

| Example | Commands | Status Bar | Tree View | Network | Editor API | Config |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------|---------|------------|--------|
| Hello World | ✓ | - | - | - | - | - |
| Word Counter | - | ✓ | - | - | ✓ | - |
| Custom Formatter | ✓ | - | - | - | ✓ | ✓ |
| File Explorer | ✓ | - | ✓ | - | - | ✓ |
| AI Assistant | ✓ | ✓ | - | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Learning Path

We recommend following this path:

1. **Start with Hello World** to understand basic structure
2. **Try Word Counter** to learn about editor events
3. **Build Custom Formatter** to manipulate editor content
4. **Create File Explorer** to work with tree views
5. **Implement AI Assistant** to integrate external services

## Common Patterns

All examples demonstrate these best practices:

- **Error Handling** - Proper try-catch blocks
- **Cleanup** - Disposing resources in `deactivate()`
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe code with JSDoc comments
- **Async/Await** - Modern async patterns
- **Event Listeners** - Proper listener registration and cleanup
- **User Feedback** - Notifications, progress indicators, and status updates

## General Questions

### What is Lokus?

Lokus is a **local-first knowledge management platform** that combines powerful note-taking with advanced features like database views (Bases), graph visualization, and AI integration. Think of it as Obsidian + Notion + AI, but faster, privacy-focused, and completely free.

**Key highlights:**
- Local-only storage (your data never leaves your computer)
- Plain markdown files (future-proof and portable)
- Blazing fast Rust backend (100x faster search)
- Built-in database views (Bases)
- Native AI integration via MCP (68+ tools)
- Free and open source (MIT license)

### Why was Lokus created?

Lokus was born from frustration with existing tools:
- **Notion**: Great features but cloud-only, privacy concerns, subscription costs
- **Obsidian**: Excellent local-first approach but lacks built-in databases and AI
- **Roam**: Pioneered bidirectional linking but expensive ($180/year) and cloud-only

Lokus combines the best of all worlds: local-first privacy, database functionality, AI integration, and modern performance—all free and open source.

### Is Lokus really free?

**Yes, completely free forever.** No hidden costs, no premium tiers, no subscription fees.

- Free for personal use
- Free for commercial use
- Free for unlimited notes
- Free for unlimited storage (limited only by your hard drive)
- Free for all features (Bases, AI, Graph, etc.)

Lokus is MIT-licensed open source. You can even modify the code if you want.

### How does Lokus make money if it's free?

Lokus is a community-driven open source project, not a commercial product. Development is funded by:
- Open source contributors donating time
- Optional donations from users (not required)
- Potential future enterprise features (never affecting core free product)

The philosophy: **Core Lokus will always be free.** Any future revenue would come from optional services (like hosted sync for enterprises), not paywalling features.

### Who is Lokus for?

Lokus is perfect for:

**Researchers & Academics**: Local storage for sensitive research, LaTeX support, citation management, graph visualization

**Developers & Engineers**: Fast performance, Git-friendly markdown, syntax highlighting (100+ languages), MCP AI for code

</Steps>

[Full installation guide →](/getting-started/installation)

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum:**
- OS: Windows 10, macOS 11, or Linux (kernel 4.15+)
- RAM: 2GB
- Storage: 200MB for app + space for your notes
- CPU: Any 64-bit processor

**Recommended:**
- RAM: 4GB+ (for large vaults with 1,000+ notes)
- SSD: For faster search and file access
- CPU: Multi-core for better performance

Lokus is lightweight and runs well on older hardware. The Rust backend is very efficient.

### Do I need an account to use Lokus?

**No account required!** Lokus is fully local:
- No sign-up process
- No login credentials
- No email verification
- No terms of service to accept
- No data collection

Just download, install, and start using it. Your data stays on your computer.

### Where does Lokus store my data?

**Your data is stored wherever you choose:**

When creating a workspace, you select a folder on your computer. Lokus stores all notes as plain markdown files (`.md`) in that folder. You have complete control.

**Application data** (settings, plugins, themes):
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\lokus`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/lokus`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/lokus`

Your notes are separate from application settings, so you can:
- Move them anywhere
- Sync them with Git, Dropbox, etc.
- Back them up easily
- Access them with other apps

### Can I use multiple workspaces?

**Yes!** You can have as many workspaces as you want:

- Create separate workspaces for work, personal, research, etc.
- Each workspace is just a folder on your computer
- Switch between workspaces: File → Switch Workspace
- Recent workspaces shown in welcome screen

**Use cases:**
- Personal vs. work notes (keep them separate)
- Different projects (client A, client B, side project)
- Shared vs. private (sync one to cloud, keep another local)
- Testing (try new plugins without affecting main vault)

### How do I set up sync between devices?

Lokus doesn't have built-in sync (by design—keeps it simple and free), but you can use any sync method:

**Option 1: Git (Recommended for developers)**
```bash
cd ~/lokus-vault
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/notes.git
git push -u origin main
```

On other device:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/notes.git ~/lokus-vault
```

**Option 2: Cloud Storage**
- Put Lokus folder in Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud Drive
- Let cloud service handle sync
- Works automatically

**Option 3: Syncthing (Self-hosted)**
- Free, open source, peer-to-peer sync
- No cloud servers, direct device-to-device
- Very secure and private

**Option 4: rsync (Linux/Mac)**
```bash
rsync -av ~/lokus-vault/ user@server:~/lokus-vault/
```

> **Note:** 
**Git is recommended** for developers: version control + sync in one. Plus, it's free with GitHub/GitLab.


### Can I import notes from other apps?

**Yes!** Lokus can import from:

**Obsidian**: Just point Lokus to your Obsidian vault folder—works immediately (same markdown format)

**Notion**: Export from Notion (Markdown & CSV), then import to Lokus. [See migration guide →](/comparison#notion)

**Roam**: Export as Markdown, convert with `roam-to-markdown` tool, import to Lokus. [See migration guide →](/comparison#roam)

**Logseq**: Point Lokus to Logseq folder—both apps can coexist on same data

**Evernote**: Export as ENEX, convert with `yarle` tool, import to Lokus

**Plain text**: Copy `.md` or `.txt` files directly into Lokus folder

**Word/Google Docs**: Use Pandoc to convert to markdown:
```bash
pandoc document.docx -o document.md
```

## Features & Functionality

### What is markdown and why does Lokus use it?

**Markdown** is a simple text formatting language. Instead of buttons (like Word), you use characters:

```markdown
# This is a heading
**This is bold**
*This is italic*
[This is a link](https://example.com)
- This is a bullet point
```

**Why Lokus uses markdown:**
- **Universal**: Works in any text editor (VS Code, Vim, Notepad)
- **Future-proof**: Plain text never goes obsolete
- **Git-friendly**: Perfect for version control
- **Human-readable**: Easy to read even without rendering
- **Portable**: Move notes anywhere, anytime
- **Standard**: Open format, not proprietary

You can edit Lokus notes with any app—not locked to Lokus.

### What are Wiki Links?

**Wiki links** create connections between notes using double brackets:

```markdown
See [[Project Planning]] for details.
This relates to [[Research Notes]] and [[Ideas]].
```

**Features:**
- **Autocomplete**: Type `[[` and get suggestions
- **Create on click**: Link to non-existent note creates it
- **Bidirectional**: Shows both outgoing and incoming links
- **Graph visualization**: See all connections visually

**Why they're powerful:**
- Build a network of connected knowledge
- Discover relationships between ideas
- Navigate your notes like Wikipedia
- Enable "networked thinking"

## Performance

### How fast is Lokus compared to other apps?

**Very fast.** Lokus uses a Rust backend for performance-critical operations:

**Search performance (10,000 notes):**
- Lokus Quantum Search: ~10ms
- Obsidian: ~1 second
- Notion: ~5-10 seconds

**Startup time:**
- Lokus: &lt;1 second
- Obsidian: 1-2 seconds
- Notion: 2-5 seconds

**Graph rendering (1,000 nodes):**
- Lokus 3D: 60fps (hardware-accelerated)
- Obsidian 2D: ~30fps
- Notion: No graph

**Memory usage (5,000 notes):**
- Lokus: ~200MB
- Obsidian: ~300MB
- Notion: ~500MB+ (web app)

The Rust backend makes Lokus 10-100x faster for intensive operations.

### What is Quantum Search?

**Quantum Search** is Lokus's ultra-fast search engine, powered by Rust:

**Performance:**
- 100x faster than traditional search
- Handles 10,000+ notes in milliseconds
- Sub-millisecond query processing
- Real-time results as you type

**Features:**
- Full-text search across all notes
- Fuzzy matching (typo-tolerant)
- Regular expressions
- File name search
- Tag search
- Property search (Bases)

**How to enable:**
Settings → Performance → Enable Quantum Search → Restart Lokus

**System requirements:**
- 4GB RAM (for large vaults)
- SSD recommended (faster indexing)

[Learn more about Quantum Search →](/features/search)

### Can Lokus handle large vaults?

**Yes!** Lokus is optimized for large note collections:

**Tested scale:**
- 10,000+ notes: Excellent performance
- 50,000+ notes: Good performance (with Quantum Search)
- 100,000+ notes: Functional (may need tuning)

**Performance optimizations:**
- Incremental indexing (only index changed files)
- Lazy loading (load content on demand)
- Virtual scrolling (render only visible items)
- Background processing (don't block UI)
- Rust backend (native-level speed)

**Tips for large vaults:**
1. Enable Quantum Search
2. Use SSD (faster file access)
3. Increase RAM if needed
4. Close unused Bases tabs
5. Exclude large folders (node_modules, archives)

### Why does Lokus use less battery than Electron apps?

**Lokus uses Tauri (Rust), not Electron:**

**Electron (used by Obsidian, VS Code):**
- Bundles entire Chromium browser
- JavaScript engine constantly running
- High CPU usage even when idle
- ~100-200MB base memory overhead

**Tauri (used by Lokus):**
- Uses system webview (already on your computer)
- Rust backend (native code, very efficient)
- Low CPU usage when idle
- ~50-80MB base memory overhead

**Result:**
- 30-50% less CPU usage
- 30-50% less RAM usage
- Longer battery life on laptops
- Faster startup

### What are the performance tips?

**For large vaults (5,000+ notes):**

1. **Enable Quantum Search**
   - Settings → Performance → Quantum Search
   - 100x faster indexing and search

2. **Use SSD, not HDD**
   - SSDs dramatically faster for file operations
   - Indexing 10,000 notes: SSD ~2s, HDD ~30s

3. **Increase RAM allocation**
   - Settings → Performance → Memory Limit
   - Recommended: 1GB per 10,000 notes

4. **Exclude unnecessary folders**
   - Settings → Files → Excluded Folders
   - Exclude: `node_modules`, `.git`, archives

5. **Close unused Bases**
   - Each open Base uses memory
   - Close tabs you're not actively using

6. **Optimize images**
   - Compress large images
   - Use web-optimized formats (WebP)

7. **Archive old notes**
   - Move old notes to separate archive folder
   - Exclude archive from indexing

  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/lokus/settings.json`
  - Linux: `~/.config/lokus/settings.json`

**4. Reinstall:**
- Uninstall Lokus
- Download latest version
- Install fresh

**5. Check antivirus:**
- Some antivirus blocks Tauri apps
- Add Lokus to whitelist

**Still not working?**
- [Report issue on GitHub](https://github.com/lokus-ai/lokus/issues)
- Include: OS, version, error message, steps to reproduce

### Search is slow or not working

**Fixes:**

**1. Enable Quantum Search:**
- Settings → Performance → Enable Quantum Search
- Restart Lokus

**2. Rebuild search index:**
- Settings → Search → Rebuild Index
- Wait for completion (may take a few minutes)

**3. Check excluded folders:**
- Settings → Files → Excluded Folders
- Make sure important folders aren't excluded

**4. Clear search cache:**
- Settings → Search → Clear Cache

**5. Reduce vault size:**
- Large vaults (50,000+ notes) need more RAM
- Consider archiving old notes

### Notes aren't syncing between devices

Lokus doesn't have built-in sync (you choose your method). Check your sync setup:

**Git sync:**
```bash
# On device 1
git pull  # Get changes from other devices
git add .
git commit -m "Update"
git push

# On device 2
git pull  # Get changes
```

**Cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive):**
- Check if sync service is running
- Check for sync conflicts (duplicate files)
- Ensure folder isn't paused

**Syncthing:**
- Check if both devices are connected
- Check sync status in Syncthing UI

**Common issues:**
- **Merge conflicts**: Resolve in Git or your sync tool
- **File locks**: Close Lokus on other device
- **Network**: Ensure internet connection

### Graph view is laggy or not showing connections

**Fixes:**

**1. Reduce visible nodes:**
- Graph view → Filters → Limit to recent notes
- Or filter by specific tags/folders

**2. Use 2D instead of 3D:**
- 3D requires more GPU power
- Switch to 2D if experiencing lag

**3. Update graphics drivers:**
- 3D graph uses WebGL (requires updated drivers)
- Download latest drivers for your GPU

**4. Disable physics simulation:**
- Graph view → Settings → Static layout
- Faster but less dynamic

**5. Rebuild graph index:**
- Settings → Graph → Rebuild Graph Index

**Graph showing no connections:**
- Make sure you're using wiki links: `[[Note Name]]`
- Check if notes are in excluded folders

### Bases (databases) not updating

**Fixes:**

**1. Refresh Base:**
- Click refresh icon in Base toolbar

**2. Rebuild Base index:**
- Base settings → Rebuild Index

**3. Check YAML frontmatter:**
Ensure properties are in frontmatter:
```markdown
---
title: My Note
status: Active
priority: High
---

Note content here...
```

**4. Verify property types:**
- Check property configuration in Base
- Ensure values match expected types (date, number, etc.)

**5. Close and reopen Base:**
- Sometimes cached data needs refresh

### Plugins aren't working

**Fixes:**

**1. Check if plugin is enabled:**
- Settings → Plugins → Find plugin → Toggle enabled

**2. Update plugin:**
- Settings → Plugins → Check for updates

**3. Check plugin permissions:**
- Settings → Plugins → Plugin name → Permissions
- Grant necessary permissions

**4. Restart Lokus:**
- Some plugins need restart to activate

**5. Check plugin compatibility:**
- Settings → Plugins → Plugin name → Details
- Ensure plugin supports your Lokus version

**6. Reinstall plugin:**
- Uninstall plugin
- Restart Lokus
- Reinstall from marketplace

**7. Check console for errors:**
- View → Developer → Toggle Developer Tools
- Check Console tab for errors

### High memory usage

**Possible causes and fixes:**

**1. Large vault:**
- 10,000+ notes use more RAM
- Increase system RAM if possible

**2. Too many open tabs:**
- Close unused note tabs
- Close unused Base tabs

**3. Memory leak in plugin:**
- Disable plugins one by one to identify culprit
- Report to plugin developer

**4. Large images/PDFs:**
- Compress large attachments
- Settings → Performance → Limit inline preview size

**5. Clear cache:**
- Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache

**6. Restart Lokus:**
- Periodic restart clears memory

### Files or folders missing

**Possible causes:**

**1. Excluded from workspace:**
- Settings → Files → Excluded Folders
- Remove from exclusion list

**2. Hidden files:**
- Settings → Files → Show hidden files (enable)

**3. File system issues:**
- Check file still exists in folder (outside Lokus)
- Check file permissions

**4. Sync conflict:**
- Check for duplicate files (e.g., `note.conflict-2025-10-23.md`)
- Resolve in sync tool

**5. Refresh workspace:**
- File → Refresh Workspace
- Or restart Lokus

## Migration & Data

### How do I migrate from Obsidian?

**Super easy!** Obsidian and Lokus use the same markdown format:

<Steps>

### Open Obsidian Vault in Lokus

1. Open Lokus
2. File → Open Workspace
3. Select your Obsidian vault folder
4. Done! Everything works immediately.

### Verify Compatibility

- Wiki links `[[like this]]` work identically
- YAML frontmatter is fully supported
- Tags, embeds, LaTeX all work

### Use Both Apps (Optional)

You can run Obsidian and Lokus on the same vault simultaneously:
- Use Obsidian for mobile
- Use Lokus for desktop power

### Replace Plugins

Find Lokus equivalents:
- Dataview → Lokus Bases (built-in)
- Kanban → Bases kanban view
- Templater → Lokus Templates

</Steps>

**Migration time: 5 minutes** (literally just opening the folder)

[Detailed Obsidian migration guide →](/comparison#obsidian)

### How do I migrate from Notion?

**Medium complexity** (2-4 hours):

<Steps>

### Export from Notion

1. Notion → Settings & Members → Settings
2. "Export all workspace content"
3. Format: Markdown & CSV
4. Download ZIP

### Clean Up Export

Notion export is messy. Clean it:

```bash
# Remove Notion IDs from filenames
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i '' 's/ [a-f0-9]\{32\}\.md//g' {} \;

# Fix image links
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i '' 's/%20/ /g' {} \;
```

Or use: `notion-to-markdown-converter` tool

### Import to Lokus

1. Open Lokus
2. File → Open Workspace
3. Select cleaned folder

### Convert Databases

Notion databases export as CSV:

1. Create Base in Lokus
2. Import CSV
3. Map columns to properties
4. Configure views

### Fix Wiki Links

Tools → Convert Links → Notion to Wiki Links

Converts `[Title](file.md)` to `[[Title]]`

</Steps>

[Detailed Notion migration guide →](/comparison#notion)

### Can I export my notes from Lokus?

**Your notes are already exported!** They're plain markdown files in a folder.

**No export needed:**
- Copy folder anywhere
- Open with any markdown editor
- Commit to Git
- Sync to cloud

**Additional export formats:**

**Bases to CSV:**
- Open Base → Export → CSV

**Notes to PDF:**
- Open note → File → Export to PDF

**Entire vault to static site:**
- Use static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo, MkDocs)
- Many Lokus users publish documentation this way

**No lock-in:** Your data is yours, in an open format, always accessible.

### How do I organize my notes?

**Popular organization methods:**

**1. Folder-based (hierarchical):**
```
/Work
  /Projects
  /Meetings
  /Clients
/Personal
  /Journal
  /Ideas
/Archive
```

**2. Tag-based (flat):**
- Keep notes in root folder
- Use tags: #work, #personal, #project-a
- Filter and search by tags

**3. Hybrid (folders + tags):**
- Top-level folders for major areas
- Tags for cross-cutting concerns
- Example: `/Work` folder + `#urgent` tag

**4. Zettelkasten (linked notes):**
- Atomic notes (one idea per note)
- Heavy use of [[wiki links]]
- Numbers/IDs for notes: `202510231045 Note.md`
- [Zettelkasten guide →](/tutorials/zettelkasten)

**5. PARA Method:**
- Projects (active)
- Areas (ongoing)
- Resources (reference)
- Archive (completed)

**Tips:**
- Start simple, evolve over time
- Use what feels natural to YOU
- Folders for structure, tags for flexibility
- Don't over-organize (diminishing returns)

### What's the best workflow for daily notes?

**Daily notes** are notes created automatically each day:

**Setup daily notes:**
1. Settings → Daily Notes → Enable
2. Set folder (e.g., `/daily`)
3. Set template (optional)
4. Set hotkey (e.g., Cmd/Ctrl+D)

**Template example:**
```markdown
---
date: {{date}}
tags: [daily]
---

# {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}

## Tasks
- [ ]

## Notes


## Journal


## Links to other notes
-
```

**Workflows:**

**1. Morning routine:**
- Open daily note (Cmd/Ctrl+D)
- Review yesterday's note
- Plan today's tasks
- Link to relevant project notes

**2. Throughout day:**
- Quick capture in daily note
- Link to related notes: `See [[Project X]]`
- Tasks that emerge: `- [ ] Do thing`

**3. Evening review:**
- Review what happened
- Move tasks to project notes
- Journal/reflection
- Plan tomorrow

**Why daily notes:**
- Capture without deciding where to put it
- Chronological record
- Link to projects: `Worked on [[Project X]]`
- Easy to find: just search by date

## Advanced Topics

### Can I use Lokus with version control (Git)?

**Absolutely!** Lokus is Git-friendly:

**Why Git + Lokus is powerful:**
- Version history (see changes over time)
- Collaboration (merge changes from team)
- Backup (remote repos are backups)
- Sync (pull/push across devices)

**Setup Git:**

```bash
cd ~/lokus-vault

# Initialize repo
git init

# Create .gitignore
echo ".lokus/cache" > .gitignore
echo ".DS_Store" >> .gitignore
echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore

# First commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add remote (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/notes.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Daily workflow:**
```bash
# Pull changes from other devices
git pull

# Make changes in Lokus...

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Daily notes and project updates"
git push
```

**Advanced:**
- Use Git plugin for Lokus (commit from UI)
- Set up Git hooks (auto-commit on close)
- Use Git LFS for large files

### How do I use Lokus with Obsidian (same vault)?

**Yes, they can coexist!** Both use standard markdown:

**Use case: Desktop + Mobile**
- Use Lokus on desktop (performance, Bases, AI)
- Use Obsidian on mobile (mature mobile apps)
- Same vault, no conflicts

**Setup:**
1. Use existing Obsidian vault or Lokus workspace
2. Open same folder in both apps
3. Both apps work on same files

**Considerations:**

**Compatible:**
- Markdown files
- Wiki links `[[like this]]`
- YAML frontmatter
- Tags
- Embeds
- LaTeX

**App-specific (won't transfer):**
- Plugin data (unless plugin exists in both)
- App settings (separate configs)
- Cached data

**Workflow:**
- Morning/evening: Review in Lokus (Bases, graphs)
- During day: Quick edits in Obsidian mobile
- Both apps see all changes

**Caution:**
- Don't edit same note simultaneously in both
- Let sync finish before switching

### Can I script or automate Lokus?

**Yes!** Several automation options:

**1. MCP API (for AI assistants):**
- 68+ tools for AI automation
- Read/write notes programmatically
- Query Bases
- [MCP documentation →](/developers/mcp/overview)

**2. Plugin API:**
- Write plugins to automate tasks
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- [Plugin API →](/developers/plugins/api)

**3. Command-line scripts:**
Since notes are markdown files:

```bash
# Create note from template
cat template.md | sed "s/{{date}}/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/" > "note.md"

# Bulk rename
for file in *.md; do
  mv "$file" "${file// /-}"
done

# Search and replace across all notes
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/old/new/g' {} \;
```

**4. Git hooks:**
Automate on commit:

`.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-generate index of notes
ls -1 *.md > index.md
git add index.md
```

**5. Cron jobs (scheduled tasks):**
```bash
# Daily backup
0 0 * * * cp -r ~/lokus-vault ~/backups/lokus-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### How do I self-host documentation with Lokus?

**Lokus notes → static website:**

**Option 1: MkDocs**
```bash
# Install MkDocs
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material

# Configure
cat > mkdocs.yml << EOF
site_name: My Documentation
theme:
  name: material
docs_dir: ~/lokus-vault
EOF

# Build
mkdocs build

# Serve locally
mkdocs serve

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

**Option 2: Hugo**
```bash
# Install Hugo
brew install hugo  # macOS

# Create site
hugo new site my-docs

# Copy Lokus notes to content/
cp -r ~/lokus-vault/* my-docs/content/

# Build
hugo

# Deploy (to Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)
```

**Option 3: Nextra (Next.js)**
- Same framework this documentation uses
- Great for technical docs
- MDX support (React in markdown)

**Why self-host docs:**
- Free hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify)
- Version controlled
- No vendor lock-in
- Custom domain
- Collaborative editing

### Can I use Lokus for a team wiki?

**Yes, with some setup:**

**Sharing options:**

**1. Git repository (recommended):**
- Create shared Git repo
- Team members clone repo
- Each uses Lokus on local clone
- Commit and push changes
- Pull to get team updates

**2. Shared network drive:**
- Put Lokus folder on shared drive
- Team members open same folder
- Be careful: don't edit simultaneously

**3. Cloud storage (Dropbox, etc.):**
- Shared Dropbox/Drive folder
- Similar to option 2

**Limitations (no real-time collaboration):**
- Lokus is single-user (currently)
- No real-time editing (like Google Docs)
- Must merge changes via Git
- Team collaboration features coming later

**Best practices:**
- Use Git for merge conflict resolution
- Communicate who's editing what
- Use branches for big changes
- Review changes via Git diffs

**Future:** Real-time collaboration on roadmap (v1.5+)

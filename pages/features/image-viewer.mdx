# Image Viewer

Lokus features a professional-grade image viewer that provides a rich viewing experience for images in your knowledge base.

<Callout type="info">
The Image Viewer was introduced in **v1.3.4** (PR #196) with full modal and tab integration.
</Callout>

## Overview

The Image Viewer provides two viewing modes:

- **Modal Viewer**: Full-screen immersive viewing that overlays your workspace
- **Tab Viewer**: View images in dedicated tabs alongside your notes

Both modes share the same powerful features: zoom controls, pan navigation, keyboard shortcuts, and metadata display.

## Opening Images

### From Embedded Images

Click any image embedded in your markdown notes:

```markdown
![My diagram](./images/diagram.png)
```

When you click the image in the editor, it opens in the **Modal Viewer** with full-screen display.

### From File Browser

Right-click any image file in the file browser:

1. Right-click the image file (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.svg`, `.webp`, `.bmp`)
2. Select **"Open in Image Viewer"** from context menu
3. Image opens in a new **Tab Viewer** in your tab bar

### Supported Formats

- **PNG** - Portable Network Graphics

- **GIF** - Graphics Interchange Format
- **SVG** - Scalable Vector Graphics
- **WebP** - Modern web image format
- **BMP** - Bitmap images

## Viewer Features

### Zoom Controls

The Image Viewer provides precise zoom control:

- **Zoom Range**: 25% to 500% (0.25x to 5x)
- **Zoom Increments**: 25% per step
- **Default**: Images start at 100% (actual size)

**Zoom Methods:**

<Callout>
The control bar appears when you hover over the image and fades away when idle for a cleaner viewing experience.
</Callout>

### Pan and Navigation

When zoomed beyond 100%, you can pan to view different areas:

## Troubleshooting

### Image Won't Open

**Symptoms**: Image doesn't open when clicked

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Format**: Ensure image is a supported format
2. **File Permissions**: Verify Lokus can read the file
3. **File Path**: Ensure relative paths are correct
4. **Reload**: Try refreshing the workspace

### Blurry or Pixelated

**Symptoms**: Image appears blurry or low quality

**Solutions:**
1. **Zoom Level**: Check if zoomed beyond 100%
2. **Source Quality**: Verify original image resolution
3. **File Format**: Some formats (e.g., SVG) scale better than others
4. **Reset Zoom**: Press `0` to return to actual size

### Navigation Arrows Missing

**Symptoms**: Can't navigate to next/previous images

**Reasons:**
- Only one image in current context
- No other images in the workspace
- Current view is filtered or scoped

**Solutions:**
1. Open multiple images first
2. Check workspace for other image files
3. Remove folder scopes if active

### Controls Don't Appear

**Symptoms**: Control bar or buttons don't show

**Solutions:**
1. **Move Mouse**: Hover over image to trigger controls
2. **Check Theme**: Ensure theme has proper contrast
3. **Try Keyboard**: Use keyboard shortcuts as alternative
4. **Reload**: Refresh the page if controls are stuck

### Metadata Sidebar Empty

**Symptoms**: Info sidebar shows no information

**Reasons:**
- Viewing embedded base64 image (no file metadata)
- File metadata not yet loaded
- Backend communication issue

**Solutions:**
1. For embedded images: No file metadata available
2. Wait a moment for metadata to load
3. Close and reopen the viewer

## Best Practices

### Organizing Images

- **Dedicated Folder**: Keep images in `/images` or `/assets` folder
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear filenames (e.g., `architecture-diagram-2024.png`)
- **Size Optimization**: Compress images before adding to workspace
- **Format Choice**: Use WebP for photos, PNG for diagrams/screenshots

### Embedding Images

```markdown
# Good - Relative path with descriptive alt text
![System Architecture Diagram](./images/architecture.png)

# Good - Clear, descriptive link text
See the [network topology diagram](./diagrams/network.png) for details.

# Better - With dimensions for layout
![Logo](./logo.png){width=200}
```

### Performance Tips

- **Reasonable Sizes**: Keep images under 5MB when possible
- **Appropriate Formats**: Use optimal formats (WebP > PNG > JPEG for most use cases)
- **Lazy Loading**: Don't load all images at once - view on demand
- **Cache Clearing**: Restart Lokus if image viewer becomes sluggish

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the Image Viewer:

- **Image Editing**: Basic crop, rotate, and annotation tools
- **Gallery View**: Thumbnail grid for browsing all images
- **Slideshow Mode**: Auto-play through images with customizable timing
- **Comparison Mode**: Side-by-side image comparison tools
- **Export Options**: Save zoomed view or annotated versions
- **EXIF Data**: Display camera and lens metadata for photos

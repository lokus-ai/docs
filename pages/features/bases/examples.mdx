## Best Practices

### Base Design Principles

**1. Start Simple**
- Begin with 5-8 core properties
- Add complexity as needed
- Don't over-engineer upfront

**2. Consistent Naming**
```yaml
# Good
due_date, start_date, end_date

# Avoid
dueDate, StartDate, end-date
```

**3. Use Defaults**
```yaml
status:
  default: "Backlog"
created_date:
  default: "{{today}}"
```

**4. Required Fields**
- Only mark truly essential fields
- Too many required fields = friction
- Usually just `title` is required

**5. Color Coding**
- Green = positive/complete
- Red = negative/urgent/blocked
- Yellow = warning/in-progress
- Blue = neutral/new
- Gray = inactive/archived

### Property Organization

**Group Related Properties:**
```yaml
# 1. Identity (top)
title
description

# 2. Status & Classification
status
priority
category
tags

# 3. People
owner
assignee
team

# 4. Dates
start_date
due_date
completed_date

# 5. Metrics (bottom)
budget
hours
progress
```

### Performance Optimization

**For Large Bases (1,000+ entries):**

1. **Use specific source folders**
   ```yaml
   source: "/projects/active"
   # Not: "/"
   ```

2. **Add default filters**
   ```yaml
   default_filters:
     - status not_equals "Archived"
   ```

3. **Enable Quantum Search**
   - Preferences ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí Quantum Search

4. **Limit visible properties**
   - Show 6-8 columns max in table view

5. **Use pagination**
   - 50-100 entries per page

### Data Entry Efficiency

**Use Templates:**
```markdown
---
template: project
status: planning
priority: medium
owner: "{{current_user}}"
start_date: "{{today}}"
---

# {{title}}

## Overview
{{description}}

## Goals
- Goal 1
- Goal 2

## Tasks
- [ ] Initial task
```

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Cmd/Ctrl + N` - New entry
- `Cmd/Ctrl + E` - Edit selected
- `Tab` - Next cell
- `Enter` - Edit cell
- `Esc` - Cancel edit

### Maintenance Routines

**Daily:**
- Update task statuses
- Check overdue items
- Process inbox/new items

**Weekly:**
- Review all active items
- Archive completed items
- Update priorities
- Schedule next week's work

**Monthly:**
- Analyze trends and metrics
- Clean up old data
- Review and adjust workflows
- Update templates

## Troubleshooting

### Base Loading Slowly

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce visible entries with filters
2. Enable Quantum Search
3. Use specific source folder
4. Hide unused properties
5. Close unused Base tabs

### Missing Data

**Solutions:**
1. Check YAML frontmatter format
2. Verify property names match
3. Refresh Base index
4. Check file permissions

### Inline Editing Not Working

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure file is not read-only
2. Check property is editable
3. Validate YAML syntax
4. Wait for auto-save (300ms)

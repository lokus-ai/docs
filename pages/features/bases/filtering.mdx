# Base Filtering & Queries

Filtering is one of the most powerful features in Bases, allowing you to narrow down large datasets to exactly what you need. Lokus v1.3 supports comprehensive filtering with multiple operator types and complex query combinations.

> **📚 Prerequisites:** This guide builds on [Bases Overview](/features/bases/overview) and [Properties](/features/bases/properties). Start there if you're new to Bases.

## Filter Types & Operators

### Text Operators

Filter text-based properties with precision.

**Available Operators:**

```yaml
equals           # Exact match (case-sensitive)
not_equals       # Not equal
contains         # Contains substring
not_contains     # Doesn't contain substring
starts_with      # Starts with text
ends_with        # Ends with text
is_empty         # No value or empty string
is_not_empty     # Has a value
matches_regex    # Regular expression match
```

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Find notes titled exactly "Project Alpha"
title equals "Project Alpha"

# Find notes with "urgent" anywhere in title
title contains "urgent"

# Find notes starting with "WIP:"
title starts_with "WIP:"

# Find notes with empty description
description is_empty

# Find notes matching pattern
title matches_regex "^PRJ-\d{4}$"
```

**Use Cases:**
- Finding specific projects by name
- Identifying incomplete records
- Pattern matching for codes/IDs
- Text content searches

> **💡 Tip:** Use `contains` for flexible searches, `equals` for exact matches. Most searches benefit from `contains`.

### Number Operators

Filter numeric properties with mathematical precision.

**Available Operators:**

```yaml
equals                  # Equal to
not_equals              # Not equal to
greater_than            # >
greater_than_or_equal   # >=
less_than               # <
less_than_or_equal      # <=
between                 # Between two values (inclusive)
is_empty                # No value set
is_not_empty            # Has a value
```

**Examples:**

```yaml
# High priority items (score > 80)
priority_score greater_than 80

# Budget between $10K and $50K
budget between 10000 50000

# Items with cost assigned
cost is_not_empty

# Exact quantity match
quantity equals 100

# Low stock items
stock_quantity less_than 10
```

**Use Cases:**
- Budget filtering
- Score/rating ranges
- Quantity thresholds
- Performance metrics

> **⚠️ Warning:** `between` is inclusive on both ends. `between 10 20` includes both 10 and 20.

### Date Operators

Filter date properties with both absolute and relative date logic.

**Available Operators:**

```yaml
equals           # Exact date match
before           # Before date
after            # After date
between          # Between two dates
relative         # Relative to today (see below)
is_empty         # No date set
is_not_empty     # Has a date
```

**Relative Date Options:**

```yaml
last 7 days      # Past week
last 30 days     # Past month
this week        # Current week (Mon-Sun)
this month       # Current calendar month
next week        # Upcoming week
next month       # Upcoming month
today            # Today only
yesterday        # Yesterday only
tomorrow         # Tomorrow only
```

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Due today
due_date equals today

# Overdue items
due_date before today

# Due in the next week
due_date between today next_7_days

# Items due this month
due_date relative "this month"

# Recently modified
modified_date relative "last 7 days"

# No due date set
due_date is_empty
```

**Use Cases:**
- Overdue task detection
- Recently created/modified items
- Upcoming deadlines
- Scheduling and planning

> **💡 Tip:** Relative dates update automatically! "last 7 days" always means the most recent week, no manual updates needed.

### Array Operators (Tags/Multi-Select)

Filter properties with multiple values.

**Available Operators:**

```yaml
contains_any     # Contains any of the specified values
contains_all     # Contains all specified values
is_empty         # Empty array or no tags
is_not_empty     # Has at least one tag
```

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Items tagged with "urgent" OR "high-priority"
tags contains_any ["urgent", "high-priority"]

# Items tagged with BOTH "web" AND "frontend"
tags contains_all ["web", "frontend"]

# Untagged items
tags is_empty

# Items with at least one category
categories is_not_empty
```

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-category filtering
- Skill matching
- Tag-based organization
- Feature flag filtering

> **💡 Tip:** Use `contains_any` for broad searches (OR logic), `contains_all` for specific combinations (AND logic).

### Boolean (Checkbox) Operators

Filter true/false properties.

**Available Operators:**

```yaml
is_true          # Value is true
is_false         # Value is false
is_empty         # No value set (neither true nor false)
```

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Completed items
completed is_true

# Incomplete items
completed is_false

# Items without published status set
is_public is_empty

# Active items
is_active is_true
```

**Use Cases:**
- Task completion status
- Published/draft filtering
- Active/inactive records
- Feature toggles

## Filter Groups

Combine multiple filters using logical operators to create complex queries.

### AND Logic

All conditions must be true.

**Syntax:**
```yaml
Show entries where:
  status equals "Active"
  AND priority equals "High"
  AND assignee is_not_empty
```

**Example:**
```
Find high-priority active tasks that are assigned:
- Status = Active ✓
- Priority = High ✓
- Assignee = Sarah ✓
Result: Included
```

**Use Cases:**
- Finding very specific items
- Narrowing down large datasets
- Strict criteria matching

### OR Logic

Any condition can be true.

**Syntax:**
```yaml
Show entries where:
  status equals "Urgent"
  OR priority equals "Critical"
  OR due_date before today
```

**Example:**
```
Find items needing attention (any of these):
- Status = Urgent ✓
- Priority = Normal ✗
- Due Date = Yesterday ✓
Result: Included (met OR condition)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Broadening search results
- Multiple acceptable criteria
- "Any of these" scenarios

### NOT Logic

Invert a condition.

**Syntax:**
```yaml
Show entries where:
  NOT status equals "Cancelled"
  AND NOT status equals "Done"
```

**Equivalent to:**
```yaml
status not_equals "Cancelled"
AND status not_equals "Done"
```

**Use Cases:**
- Excluding specific values
- "Everything except..." queries
- Negative filtering

### Nested Groups

Create complex logic with nested groups.

**Example 1: Urgent items or overdue high-priority items**

```yaml
Show entries where:
  status equals "Urgent"
  OR (
    priority equals "High"
    AND due_date before today
  )
```

**Breakdown:**
```
Include if:
  Status is Urgent
  OR
  (Priority is High AND Due Date is in the past)
```

**Example 2: Active projects in specific categories**

```yaml
Show entries where:
  status equals "Active"
  AND (
    category equals "Web"
    OR category equals "Mobile"
    OR category equals "API"
  )
  AND assignee is_not_empty
```

**Breakdown:**
```
Include if:
  Status is Active
  AND
  Category is Web, Mobile, or API
  AND
  Has an assignee
```

> **💡 Tip:** Use parentheses to group conditions clearly. This makes complex queries easier to understand and maintain.

## Creating Filters

### Method 1: Interactive Filter Builder

```

**Query Syntax:**
```
property:value                    # Equals
property:!value                   # Not equals
property:>value                   # Greater than
property:<value                   # Less than
property:*partial*                # Contains
tag:#tagname                      # Has tag
```

## Saved Filters

### Creating Saved Filters

Save commonly-used filter combinations:

1. Configure your filters
2. Click **"Save Filter"** button
3. Name the filter (e.g., "Overdue High Priority")
4. Optional: Set as default view
5. Click **Save**

**Example Saved Filters:**

```yaml
"Active Tasks":
  - status equals "Active"
  - assignee is_not_empty

"Overdue Items":
  - due_date before today
  - completed is_false

"This Week":
  - due_date relative "this week"
  - status not_equals "Done"

"Unassigned High Priority":
  - priority equals "High"
  - assignee is_empty
```

### Managing Saved Filters

**Quick Switch:**

3. Confirm deletion

**Share Filter:**
1. Right-click filter name
2. **"Copy Filter Link"**
3. Share with team members

> **💡 Tip:** Create saved filters for your most common workflows. Examples: "My Tasks", "This Sprint", "Needs Review".

## Pre-built Filters

Lokus includes useful pre-built filters:

**All Items**
```yaml
# No filters (default)
```

**Active Items**
```yaml
status not_equals "Done"
AND status not_equals "Cancelled"
AND status not_equals "Archived"
```

**Completed Items**
```yaml
status equals "Done"
OR completed is_true
```

**Overdue Items**
```yaml
due_date before today
AND completed is_false
```

**Assigned to Me**
```yaml
assignee equals "{{current_user}}"
```

**Unassigned**
```yaml
assignee is_empty
```

**This Week**
```yaml
due_date relative "this week"
```

**No Due Date**
```yaml
due_date is_empty
```

## Sorting

### Sort Options

Order your filtered results:

**Sort Configuration:**
```yaml
sort:
  - property: priority
    direction: desc  # High to Low
  - property: due_date
    direction: asc   # Earliest to Latest
  - property: title
    direction: asc   # A to Z
```

**Sort Types:**
- **Alphabetical**: A-Z or Z-A
- **Numeric**: 0-9 or 9-0 (ascending/descending)
- **Date**: Earliest-Latest or Latest-Earliest
- **Custom**: Manual drag-and-drop order

### Multi-Column Sorting

Sort by multiple properties:

1. Click first column header (primary sort)
2. Hold `Cmd/Ctrl` and click second header (secondary sort)
3. Hold `Cmd/Ctrl` and click third header (tertiary sort)

**Example:**
```
Sort by:
1. Priority (High → Low)
2. Due Date (Earliest → Latest)
3. Title (A → Z)

Result:
High Priority items first, ordered by due date
Medium Priority items next, ordered by due date
Low Priority items last, ordered by due date
Within each group, alphabetically by title
```

### Manual Sorting

Custom drag-and-drop ordering:

1. Click **"Manual Sort"** toggle
2. Drag rows to reorder
3. Order persists across sessions
4. Click **"Reset Sort"** to return to automatic

> **⚠️ Warning:** Manual sort overrides automatic sorting. Use for custom prioritization, but remember to reset if you want automatic sorting later.

## Grouping (Coming v1.4)

### Group By Property

Organize filtered entries into groups:

**Example:**
```yaml
Group by: Status

├─ Backlog (5 items)
│  ├─ Task A
│  ├─ Task B
│  └─ Task C
│
├─ In Progress (3 items)
│  ├─ Task D
│  └─ Task E
│
└─ Done (12 items) [collapsed]
   └─ (Hidden)
```

### Multi-Level Grouping

```yaml
Group by: Status → Priority

├─ In Progress
│  ├─ High (2 items)
│  │  ├─ Task A
│  │  └─ Task B
│  └─ Medium (1 item)
│     └─ Task C
│
└─ Done
   └─ High (3 items)
      └─ ...
```

### Group Aggregations

Show statistics per group:

```yaml
Status: In Progress (3 items)
  Total Hours: 15h
  Average: 5h per item
  Assignees: Sarah, John

Status: Done (12 items)
  Total Hours: 48h
  Average: 4h per item
  Completion Rate: 100%
```

## Advanced Query Examples

### Example 1: This Week's Priorities

```yaml
Show entries where:
  (
    due_date relative "this week"
    OR priority equals "High"
  )
  AND status not_equals "Done"
  AND assignee equals "{{current_user}}"
```

**Use Case:** See your high-priority work and this week's deadlines

### Example 2: Stale Projects

```yaml
Show entries where:
  status equals "Active"
  AND modified_date before "{{today-30d}}"
  AND assignee is_not_empty
```

**Use Case:** Find active projects not updated in 30+ days

### Example 3: Urgent Attention Needed

```yaml
Show entries where:
  (
    due_date before today
    OR priority equals "Critical"
  )
  AND completed is_false
  AND (
    status equals "Blocked"
    OR assignee is_empty
  )
```

**Use Case:** Overdue or critical items that are blocked or unassigned

### Example 4: Ready to Start

```yaml
Show entries where:
  status equals "Todo"
  AND assignee is_not_empty
  AND tags contains_any ["ready", "approved"]
  AND due_date is_not_empty
```

**Use Case:** Tasks ready to be worked on (assigned, approved, scheduled)

### Example 5: Portfolio View

```yaml
Show entries where:
  category contains_any ["Web", "Mobile", "API"]
  AND budget greater_than 10000
  AND (
    status equals "Active"
    OR status equals "Planning"
  )
```

**Use Case:** Major projects in specific categories

## Performance Tips

### Optimize Filters for Large Datasets

**Do:**
- ✅ Use specific filters early (e.g., folder source)
- ✅ Filter by indexed properties (status, dates)
- ✅ Use `equals` instead of `contains` when possible
- ✅ Limit results with pagination
- ✅ Enable [Quantum Search](/features/bases/overview#quantum-search-integration)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Use only `contains` with wildcards on large datasets
- ❌ Create overly complex nested groups (3+ levels)
- ❌ Use regex filters on non-indexed fields
- ❌ Leave filters too broad (returning 1,000+ results)

### Filter Execution Order

Filters execute in this order for best performance:

1. **Source filters** (folder, tag)
2. **Indexed properties** (status, dates, booleans)
3. **Simple comparisons** (equals, not_equals)
4. **Range comparisons** (greater_than, between)
5. **String operations** (contains, starts_with)
6. **Complex operations** (regex, nested groups)

> **💡 Tip:** Put more restrictive filters first. "status equals Active" before "title contains Project" performs better.

## Troubleshooting

### Filters Not Working

**Issue:** No results or wrong results

**Solutions:**
1. Check filter logic (AND vs OR)
2. Verify property names match YAML
3. Ensure values are correctly formatted
4. Check for empty/null values
5. Refresh Base index (Cmd/Ctrl + R)

### Slow Filter Performance

**Issue:** Filters take too long to apply

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce number of entries (use source filters)
2. Enable Quantum Search
3. Simplify complex nested groups
4. Use indexed properties when possible
5. Close other Bases to free memory

### Filter Not Saving

**Issue:** Saved filter doesn't persist

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure filter has a name
2. Check for permission issues
3. Verify workspace is syncing properly
4. Try duplicating the view first

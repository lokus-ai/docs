# Wiki Links & Backlinks

Wiki links are the foundation of connected note-taking in Lokus. They enable bidirectional linking between notes, creating a web of knowledge that mirrors how ideas naturally connect in your mind.

**Version:** 1.3.1 | **Status:** Production Ready

## What's New in v1.3

- ✅ **Improved Autocomplete** - Faster fuzzy search, better ranking, folder path display
- ✅ **Link Colors** - Now properly appear blue with hover effects
- ✅ **WikiLink Customization** - Customize bracket styles, colors, and appearance in Preferences
- ✅ **Better Conflict Resolution** - Fixed autocomplete conflicts with regular markdown links
- ✅ **Smart Suggestions** - Brackets in lists no longer trigger suggestions accidentally
- ✅ **Performance** - 5x faster link indexing and backlink retrieval
- ✅ **Real-time Updates** - Backlinks update instantly when files change

## Overview

Wiki links allow you to reference other notes using a simple `[[Note Name]]` syntax. Unlike traditional hyperlinks, wiki links automatically create backlinks, showing you all notes that reference the current note.

### Key Benefits

- **Effortless Connections:** Link notes with simple bracket syntax
- **Bidirectional Tracking:** Automatically see incoming and outgoing links
- **Discoverability:** Find related content through link networks
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Visualize your note relationships
- **Broken Link Detection:** Identify and fix missing connections

## Creating Wiki Links

### Basic Syntax

Create a wiki link by wrapping a note name in double brackets:

```markdown
[[Note Name]]
[[My Project Ideas]]
[[2024-03-15 Meeting Notes]]
```

**Features:**
- Case-sensitive or case-insensitive (configurable)
- Spaces and special characters allowed
- Relative to workspace root
- Creates note if it doesn't exist

### Autocomplete

As you type `[[`, Lokus displays an autocomplete menu:

**Autocomplete Features:**
- Fuzzy search across all notes
- Recent notes prioritized
- Folder path shown
- Keyboard navigation (↑↓, Enter)
- Filter by folder
- Shows note preview on hover

**Example:**
```markdown
[[proj     → Shows "Project Ideas", "Project Plan", etc.
```

### Link Aliases

Display different text than the note name:

```markdown
[[Note Name|Display Text]]
[[2024-Q1-Report|Q1 Report]]
[[Technical Documentation|docs]]
```

**Use Cases:**
- Shorter display text
- Natural language flow
- Alternative naming
- Localization

### Link Validation

Lokus validates links in real-time:

**Valid Link:**
- Green underline
- Click to navigate
- Hover shows preview

**Broken Link:**
- Red underline
- Click to create note
- Hover shows "Note not found"

**Ambiguous Link:**
- Yellow underline
- Multiple matches found
- Click to choose target

## Backlinks

Backlinks are automatically generated references showing which notes link to the current note.

### Backlinks Panel

Located in the right sidebar, the backlinks panel displays:

**Information Shown:**
- Note name with link
- Excerpt showing link context
- Number of references in note
- Last modified date
- Folder location

**Interactions:**
- Click to navigate to note
- Hover to preview full context
- Filter by folder
- Sort by date or name
- Group by folder or flat list

### Backlinks Display

```markdown
Current Note: "Project Ideas"

Backlinks (3):
├─ Meeting Notes 2024-03-15
│  "Discussed [[Project Ideas]] for Q2"
│
├─ Team Brainstorm
│  "Review [[Project Ideas]] and prioritize"
│  "Assign owners to [[Project Ideas]]"
│
└─ Quarterly Planning
   "Incorporate [[Project Ideas]] into roadmap"
```

![Backlinks Panel Display](/placeholder.svg)

### Unlinked Mentions

Lokus also finds unlinked mentions - text that matches note names but isn't linked:

**Example:**
```markdown
Current Note: "Python Best Practices"

Unlinked Mentions (2):
├─ Code Review Notes
│  "Follow Python Best Practices for..."
│  [Convert to Link]
│
└─ Onboarding Guide
   "Read Python Best Practices before..."
   [Convert to Link]
```

**Features:**
- One-click conversion to wiki link
- Batch conversion
- Ignore false positives
- Case-insensitive matching

## Best Practices

### Linking Strategy

**When to Link:**
- Related concepts
- Prerequisites
- Examples and instances
- Categories and tags
- Sources and references

**When Not to Link:**
- Common words (unless note exists)
- Every occurrence (link first only)
- Generic terms
- Temporary content

### Naming Conventions

**Good Note Names:**
- Clear and descriptive
- Unique and distinctive
- Searchable keywords
- Consistent format

**Examples:**
```markdown
Good:
[[Python Data Structures]]
[[Meeting Notes 2024-03-15]]
[[Project Roadmap Q2]]

Avoid:
[[Notes]]           # Too generic
[[Stuff]]           # Unclear
[[temp]]            # Temporary
[[New Note 23]]     # Meaningless
```

### Link Organization

**Hierarchy:**
- Use folders for structure
- Link notes within hierarchy
- Cross-reference between folders
- Create index notes

**Hub Notes:**
- Create overview notes
- Link to related notes
- Update regularly
- Serve as entry points

**Example Hub:**
```markdown
# Machine Learning Hub

## Fundamentals
- [[Neural Networks Basics]]
- [[Gradient Descent]]
- [[Activation Functions]]

## Frameworks
- [[TensorFlow Guide]]
- [[PyTorch Tutorial]]

## Projects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Links not working
**Solution:** Check syntax, ensure note exists, verify workspace

**Issue:** Backlinks not showing
**Solution:** Rebuild link index (Settings > Links > Rebuild)

**Issue:** Slow link autocomplete
**Solution:** Clear cache, reduce workspace size, check indexing

**Issue:** Broken links after rename
**Solution:** Use built-in rename (not file system), enable auto-update

### Debugging

**Link Inspector:**
1. Right-click link
2. Select "Inspect Link"
3. View link properties
4. See resolution path
5. Check for issues

## Migration

# Page Preview

Instantly preview linked notes without navigating away from your current page. Hover over any wiki link to see a quick preview of the target note's content.

<Callout type="info">
Page preview enhances your workflow by letting you peek at linked content without losing your place.
</Callout>

## What is Page Preview?

Page preview (also called hover preview or link preview) displays a floating popup when you hover over wiki links in your notes. This popup shows:

- The title of the linked note
- A preview of the note's content
- Smart positioning to stay on-screen

### Why Use Page Preview?

- **Stay Focused**: Check linked content without leaving your current note
- **Faster Navigation**: Decide if you need to open a link before clicking
- **Context at a Glance**: Understand references without breaking flow
- **Reduced Tab Clutter**: Fewer unnecessary note opens
- **Better Research**: Quickly scan multiple references while reading

## How It Works

<Steps>

### Step 1: Create or Find a Wiki Link

Any internal wiki link in your notes can trigger a preview:

```markdown
See the [[Project Overview]] for details.

Also check out [[Meeting Notes 2024-03-15]].
```

### Step 2: Hover Over the Link

Move your cursor over a wiki link and wait briefly (approximately 500ms). A preview popup appears near your cursor.

### Step 3: Read the Preview

The popup displays:
- The note's title in the header
- A preview of the content (currently shows placeholder text in Phase 1)
- A close button (×) in the top-right corner

### Step 4: Close or Navigate

- **Close**: Click the × button or move your cursor away from the popup
- **Open**: Click the wiki link itself to navigate to the full note

</Steps>

## Features

### Smart Positioning

The preview popup intelligently positions itself to stay visible:

- **Default**: Appears below and to the right of your cursor
- **Near Right Edge**: Shifts left to stay on-screen
- **Near Bottom**: Appears above the cursor instead of below
- **Corner Cases**: Adjusts to the nearest visible position

This ensures you can always read the preview, regardless of where the link appears on your screen.

### Theme Integration

Page previews automatically match your active theme:

- **Background**: Uses your theme's primary background color
- **Text**: Inherits your theme's text colors
- **Border**: Styled with your theme's border colors
- **Dark Mode**: Fully compatible with dark themes

### Quick Dismissal

Multiple ways to close a preview:

1. **Click the close button (×)** in the preview header
2. **Move cursor away** from the preview
3. **Click elsewhere** in your note
4. **Navigate to the link** (opens the target note)

## Current Implementation (Phase 1)

<Callout type="info">
The current version of page preview is in Phase 1, showing the basic preview structure. Future updates will add full content rendering.
</Callout>

### What's Included

✅ Preview popup appears on hover
✅ Smart positioning system
✅ Note title display
✅ Close button
✅ Theme integration
✅ Placeholder content indication

### Coming in Future Phases

The page preview feature is planned to expand with:

- **Full Content Rendering**: Display actual note content (not just placeholder text)
- **Markdown Formatting**: Render headings, lists, bold, italic, etc.
- **Image Previews**: Show images embedded in linked notes
- **Scroll Support**: Navigate through long note previews
- **Size Customization**: Adjust preview window size in preferences
- **Delay Configuration**: Control how quickly previews appear
- **Preview for Block References**: Show preview of specific blocks (`[[Note^blockid]]`)
- **External Links**: Preview metadata for external URLs

## Use Cases

### Research and Reading

Quickly verify references without losing your place:

```markdown
## Literature Review

The methodology aligns with [[Smith 2023]] and extends [[Jones 2022]]'s findings.
```

Hover over each reference to see the full citation or key points without opening multiple notes.

### Project Management

Check task details while reviewing status:

```markdown
## Sprint Status

- [[Task: Implement Authentication]] - In Progress
- [[Task: Database Migration]] - Completed
- [[Task: UI Redesign]] - Blocked (see [[Design Review Notes]])
```

Preview each task note to see current status, assignees, and blockers.

### Knowledge Navigation

Explore your knowledge graph while maintaining context:

```markdown
## Zettelkasten Note

This concept relates to [[Atomic Habits]] and contradicts [[Traditional Productivity Methods]].

See also: [[Flow State]], [[Deep Work]], [[Cal Newport's Philosophy]]
```

Hover over each link to glimpse the connected ideas without breaking your reading flow.

### Writing and Editing

Verify you're linking to the correct note:

```markdown
For installation instructions, see [[Setup Guide]].
```

Hover to confirm it's the right setup guide (not "Advanced Setup Guide" or "Quick Setup").

## Tips & Best Practices

### Hover Intentionally

The preview delay prevents accidental popups while casually moving your cursor. Pause briefly over a link to trigger the preview.

### Use for Quick Checks

Page preview is perfect for:
- ✅ Verifying you're linking to the correct note
- ✅ Checking if a reference is relevant
- ✅ Scanning key points before opening

Avoid using it for:
- ❌ Reading entire notes (open the note instead)
- ❌ Detailed analysis (better to open in a new tab/pane)

### Combine with Other Features

Page preview works great alongside:

- **Block References**: Preview specific blocks (planned feature)
- **Backlinks**: Preview notes that link to your current note
- **Graph View**: Preview nodes when exploring your knowledge graph

### Keyboard-Friendly Alternative

If you prefer keyboard navigation:
1. Tab to a wiki link (or search with `/`)
2. Press Enter to open the note directly

## Accessibility

Page preview is designed with accessibility in mind:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Close button is keyboard-accessible
- **Screen Readers**: Preview content is announced when opened
- **High Contrast**: Respects system and theme contrast settings
- **Motion**: No automatic animations that could cause discomfort

### Disabling Preview (Future)

While not currently available, future versions will include a preference to disable hover preview if it interferes with your workflow or accessibility tools.

## Comparison with Other Apps

### Obsidian

Lokus page preview is inspired by Obsidian's hover preview feature:

- Similar hover activation
- Comparable positioning logic
- Theme integration

Planned additions will bring feature parity and beyond.

### Notion

Unlike Notion's page previews (which show in a side panel), Lokus previews appear as floating popups near your cursor for faster, more contextual access.

### Roam Research

Similar to Roam's page reference popups, but with:
- Better positioning (stays on-screen)
- Theme integration
- Cleaner UI

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Not Appearing

**Problem**: Hovering over a wiki link doesn't show a preview.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you're hovering over a valid wiki link (`[[Note Name]]`)
- Wait briefly (500ms delay is normal)
- Check that the link is properly formatted
- Verify the target note exists

### Preview Appears in Wrong Position

**Problem**: Preview popup is cut off or poorly positioned.

**Likely Cause**: This is rare due to smart positioning, but can happen with:
- Very small browser windows
- Unusual screen aspect ratios

**Solutions**:
- Resize your window to give more space
- Move the link away from screen edges if possible

### Preview Content Missing

**Current Status**: Phase 1 shows placeholder text. Full content rendering is planned for future updates.

## Performance Considerations

### Lightweight Implementation

Page preview is designed for performance:
- **Minimal DOM Impact**: Preview only exists when active
- **Smart Debouncing**: Prevents excessive rendering from cursor movement
- **Lazy Content Loading**: (Future) Content loads on-demand, not preemptively

### Best Practices

For optimal performance:
- Keep notes reasonably sized (very long notes may take longer to preview in future versions)
- Avoid excessive hover triggering (let the preview appear naturally)

## Customization (Future)

Planned customization options include:

### Preview Appearance

- **Size**: Adjust width and height
- **Font Size**: Increase or decrease preview text size
- **Max Lines**: Limit preview length

### Preview Behavior

- **Hover Delay**: Control how quickly preview appears
- **Auto-Close Delay**: Set how long preview stays open
- **Trigger Method**: Choose hover, click, or keyboard shortcut

### Preview Content

- **Content Length**: Show first 100, 200, or 500 words
- **Image Display**: Show/hide images in preview
- **Format Rendering**: Choose plain text or full markdown rendering

## Related Features

- [Wiki Links](/features/wiki-links) - Internal note linking
- [Block References](/features/block-references) - Link to specific content blocks
- [Backlinks](/features/backlinks) - See all notes linking to current note

## API (For Plugin Developers)

Page preview functionality can be extended through Lokus plugins:

```javascript
// Future API (not yet implemented)
app.workspace.on('hover-link', (event) => {
  const { target, position } = event
  // Custom preview logic
})
```

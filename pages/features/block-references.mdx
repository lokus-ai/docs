# Block References

Link to and embed specific paragraphs, lists, headings, or any content block within your notes using Obsidian-compatible block reference syntax.

<Callout type="info">
Block references work identically to Obsidian's implementation, ensuring seamless migration and compatibility.
</Callout>

## What are Block References?

Block references allow you to create precise links to specific portions of a note, rather than just linking to the entire page. This is invaluable for:

- **Academic citations**: Reference specific paragraphs or quotes from research notes
- **Meeting notes**: Link to specific action items or decisions across different meetings
- **Research connections**: Build a web of knowledge linking specific ideas, not just documents
- **Task tracking**: Reference specific tasks or outcomes from project notes

Instead of linking to an entire note like `[[Project Notes]]`, you can link directly to a specific block: `[[Project Notes^decision-architecture]]`.

## Understanding Block IDs

A **block ID** is a unique identifier you assign to any block of content (paragraph, list item, heading, quote, etc.). Block IDs are created using the caret (`^`) symbol followed by an alphanumeric identifier.

### Block ID Syntax

```markdown
This is a paragraph that I want to reference later. ^my-block-id
```

The block ID appears at the end of the content and consists of:
- A space followed by `^` (caret symbol)
- An identifier using letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores: `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`
- Block IDs are case-sensitive

### Valid Block ID Examples

```markdown
This is a key finding from the research. ^research-finding-1

- Task item that needs referencing ^task-item-urgent
- Another list item ^list-2

> Important quote from the source material ^important-quote

## Section Heading ^section-intro
```

### What Can Have Block IDs?

Block IDs can be added to:
- Paragraphs
- Headings (all levels)
- List items (both ordered and unordered)
- Blockquotes
- Code blocks
- Tables
- Table rows

## Creating Block References

Once you've added a block ID to content, you can reference it from anywhere in your knowledge base.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Add a Block ID

First, add a block ID to the content you want to reference:

```markdown
The quarterly revenue increased by 23% due to new product launches. ^q4-revenue-finding
```

The block ID `^q4-revenue-finding` is now attached to this paragraph.

<Callout type="tip">
Block IDs are displayed with reduced opacity in the editor, making them visible but not distracting.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Link to the Block

In any note, create a link to the specific block using the syntax `[[filename^blockid]]`:

```markdown
According to the analysis: [[Q4 Report^q4-revenue-finding]]
```

This creates a clickable link that navigates directly to the referenced block in the Q4 Report note.

### Step 3: Customize Display Text (Optional)

You can customize how the link appears using the pipe (`|`) syntax:

```markdown
The results were impressive: [[Q4 Report^q4-revenue-finding|23% revenue increase]]
```

This displays as "23% revenue increase" but still links to the specific block.

</Steps>

## Block Link Display Format

When you create a block reference without custom text, Lokus automatically formats the link in a readable way:

```markdown
[[Meeting Notes^action-item-deploy]]
```

Displays as: **Meeting Notes › Action Item Deploy**

The filename and block ID are separated by a › symbol, with the block ID converted from kebab-case to Title Case for better readability.

## Embedding Blocks

Beyond just linking, you can **embed** the actual content of a block directly into another note using the exclamation mark (`!`) prefix.

### Embed Syntax

```markdown
![[filename^blockid]]
```

### How Embeds Work

When you embed a block:
1. The actual content of the referenced block appears inline in your current note
2. The embed shows the source filename and block ID as a header
3. The embedded content is read-only but updates if the source changes
4. Embeds are displayed with a distinct visual style (border and background)

### Embed Example

If `Research Notes` contains:

```markdown
The study found a strong correlation between sleep quality and productivity. ^sleep-study-finding
```

In another note, you can embed it:

```markdown
## Supporting Evidence

![[Research Notes^sleep-study-finding]]
```

This will display:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📄 Research Notes › sleep-study-finding │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ The study found a strong correlation    │
│ between sleep quality and productivity. │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Use Cases

### Academic Research

Link to specific findings, quotes, or methodologies across your research notes:

```markdown
## Literature Review

The methodology follows [[Smith 2023^methodology-section]].

Key findings:
- ![[Study A^finding-correlation]]
- ![[Study B^finding-causation]]
```

### Meeting Notes Cross-Referencing

Reference specific decisions or action items:

```markdown
## Project Status

Following up on [[March 15 Meeting^decision-tech-stack]], we've begun implementation.

Action items from [[March 22 Meeting^action-items-list]]:
```

### Knowledge Building

Create precise connections between ideas:

```markdown
## Zettelkasten Example

This concept relates to [[Atomic Habits^habit-loop-definition]] and builds upon [[Thinking Fast and Slow^system-1-vs-2]].
```

### Task Management

Track tasks and their outcomes across project notes:

```markdown
## Sprint Retrospective

Completed: [[Sprint 5 Planning^task-backend-api]]
Still in progress: [[Sprint 5 Planning^task-frontend-ui]]
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### Naming Block IDs

<Callout type="tip">
Use descriptive, kebab-case identifiers that make sense out of context:
- ✅ Good: `^decision-microservices-architecture`
- ✅ Good: `^finding-user-retention-rate`
- ❌ Avoid: `^block1`, `^x`, `^temp`
</Callout>

### When to Use Block References vs. Page Links

| Use Block References When | Use Page Links When |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Referencing specific findings or quotes | Referencing general topics or concepts |
| Linking to action items or decisions | Linking to entire documents |
| Building precise knowledge connections | Creating broad category links |
| Citing specific sources | Referencing background information |

### Avoiding Conflicts

- Block IDs must be unique within a single note (but can be the same across different notes)
- If you duplicate content, remember to update block IDs to maintain unique references
- Use meaningful prefixes for different types of blocks: `^finding-`, `^task-`, `^quote-`, `^decision-`

### Managing Block References

<Callout type="warning">
If you delete or rename a block ID, existing references will break. Consider:
- Searching your vault for references before deleting block IDs
- Using descriptive IDs that won't need changing
- Keeping a log of important block IDs in your notes
</Callout>

## Advanced Usage

### Block References in Lists

Create lists of referenced content:

```markdown
## Key Decisions This Quarter

1. [[Jan Board Meeting^decision-expansion]]
2. [[Feb Leadership Sync^decision-hiring-freeze]]
3. [[Mar Strategy Session^decision-product-pivot]]
```

### Combining with Regular Wiki Links

You can mix block references with regular wiki links:

```markdown
For background, see [[Product Strategy]] and specifically [[Product Strategy^vision-2024]].
```

### Block References in Templates

Use block references in templates for repeatable structures:

```markdown
## Weekly Review Template

### Last Week's Goals
- Reference: [[{{last_week_note}}^weekly-goals]]

### This Week's Plan
Add your goals here ^weekly-goals
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Type `[[` | Open wiki link autocomplete |
| Type `^` after filename | Switch to block reference mode |
| Type `![[` | Create an embed instead of a link |

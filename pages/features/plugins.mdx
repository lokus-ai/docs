## Security & Permissions

Lokus takes plugin security seriously with a comprehensive security model.

### Sandboxed Execution

**All plugins run in a secure sandbox:**

- **Isolated Environment** - Plugins cannot access each other
- **Limited System Access** - Restricted to declared permissions
- **API-Only Access** - No direct system calls
- **Resource Monitoring** - CPU and memory usage tracked
- **Automatic Termination** - Misbehaving plugins are stopped

### Permission System

Plugins must request specific permissions, which you approve during installation.

**Common Permissions:**

| Permission | Description | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `filesystem:read` | Read files from workspace | Low |
| `filesystem:write` | Write/modify files | Medium |
| `network:request` | Make HTTP requests | Medium |
| `ui:commands` | Add UI commands | Low |
| `ui:menus` | Modify menus | Low |
| `editor:modify` | Change editor content | Medium |
| `settings:read` | Read app settings | Low |
| `settings:write` | Modify app settings | Medium |
| `clipboard:read` | Read clipboard | Low |
| `clipboard:write` | Write to clipboard | Low |

**Understanding Risk Levels:**

- **Low** - Minimal risk, standard functionality
- **Medium** - Can modify data, review carefully
- **High** - System-level access, only trusted plugins

### Reviewing Permissions

**Before Installation:**

1. Read the permission list carefully
2. Understand what each permission allows
3. Consider if the plugin needs those permissions
4. Check reviews for security concerns

**Permission Dialog Shows:**
- Permission name and description
- Why the plugin needs it
- What it can access
- Risk level indicator

**Red Flags:**
- Excessive permissions for simple functionality
- Network access for offline-only features
- File write access for read-only plugins
- Unclear permission justifications

### Revoking Permissions

**After Installation:**

You can revoke permissions without uninstalling:

1. Go to Settings → Plugins → Installed
2. Select the plugin
3. Click "Permissions"
4. Toggle off unwanted permissions
5. Plugin functionality may be limited

**Note:** Some plugins may not work correctly with revoked permissions. Check plugin documentation.

### Security Best Practices

6. **Report Issues** - Help maintain marketplace quality

**Warning Signs:**

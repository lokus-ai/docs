# Automatic Updates

Lokus keeps itself up to date automatically so you always have the latest features and fixes without manual intervention.

<Callout type="info">
Auto-updates were introduced in **v1.3.4** (PR #194) to provide a seamless update experience.
</Callout>

## How It Works

Lokus uses a sophisticated auto-update system that runs in the background:

### Silent Background Checks

- **Automatic Check**: Lokus silently checks for updates **3 seconds after launch**
- **Update Source**: All updates are fetched directly from official **GitHub Releases**
- **Non-Intrusive**: The check happens in the background without disrupting your workflow
- **Smart Detection**: Only notifies you when a new version is actually available

### Update Process

1. **Detection**: Lokus compares your current version with the latest GitHub release
2. **Notification**: A modal dialog appears when an update is available
3. **Download**: Click "Update Now" to download the update in the background
4. **Progress Tracking**: Watch real-time progress with a visual progress bar
5. **Installation**: The update installs automatically on restart
6. **Seamless Restart**: The app relaunches with the new version

### Security Features

<Callout type="warning">
All updates are **cryptographically signed** to ensure authenticity and security.
</Callout>

- **Signed Releases**: Every update is digitally signed with Lokus's developer certificate
- **Signature Verification**: Updates are verified against GitHub release signatures before installation
- **No Third-Party Servers**: Updates come directly from GitHub - no intermediary servers
- **Tamper Detection**: Modified or corrupted updates are automatically rejected

## Manual Update Check

You can manually check for updates at any time:

1. Open **Preferences** (⌘+, on macOS, Ctrl+, on Windows/Linux)
2. Navigate to the **General** tab
3. Click the **"Check for Updates"** button
4. Lokus will immediately check for new versions

<Callout>
This is useful if you want to ensure you're on the latest version before an important task or if you've disabled automatic checks.
</Callout>

## Update Notifications

When an update is available, you'll see a modal dialog with:

- **Version Number**: The new version that's available (e.g., "v1.3.5")
- **Update Actions**:
  - **"Update Now"**: Downloads and installs the update immediately
  - **"Later"**: Dismisses the dialog; you'll be reminded on next launch
- **Download Progress**: Real-time progress bar during download (0-100%)
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if download or installation fails

### Update Modal Features

- **Clean Interface**: Dark/light theme support matching your preferences
- **Progress Visualization**: Smooth animated progress bar
- **Background Blur**: Subtle backdrop blur for better focus
- **Escape to Close**: Press `Esc` to dismiss and update later
- **Click Outside**: Click the backdrop to dismiss

## Configuring Auto-Updates

### Disabling Auto-Updates

If you prefer to update manually:

1. Open **Preferences** → **General**
2. Look for the auto-update settings section
3. Toggle off automatic update checks

<Callout type="warning">
Disabling auto-updates means you'll need to manually check for updates regularly to stay current with bug fixes and new features.
</Callout>

### Update Frequency

- **Launch Check**: Every time you start Lokus (after 3-second delay)
- **No Polling**: Lokus doesn't continuously check in the background while running
- **Minimal Impact**: The check is lightweight and doesn't affect performance

## Troubleshooting

### "Could Not Fetch" Error

This error is normal and automatically suppressed in the following cases:

- **First Release with Updater**: When the updater feature is first introduced
- **Old Releases**: When running very old versions that predate auto-update artifacts
- **Network Issues**: Temporary connectivity problems

**Solution**: Check your internet connection and try the manual update check.

### Update Download Fails

**Symptoms**: Progress bar stalls or error message appears

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure stable connectivity
2. **Retry**: Close the dialog and click "Check for Updates" again
3. **Firewall Settings**: Ensure Lokus can access `github.com`
4. **Manual Download**: Visit the [Lokus releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/lokus/releases) if auto-update consistently fails

### Update Doesn't Install

**Symptoms**: Download completes but app doesn't restart

**Solutions**:
1. **Manual Restart**: Quit and relaunch Lokus manually
2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure Lokus has permission to modify itself
3. **Disk Space**: Verify you have sufficient disk space for the update
4. **Admin Rights**: Some systems require administrator privileges for updates

### Update Loop

**Symptoms**: Same update notification appears repeatedly

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Version**: Go to Preferences → About to see your current version
2. **Clear Cache**: Quit Lokus and delete any temporary update files
3. **Reinstall**: Download and install the latest version manually from GitHub

## Best Practices

### Keep Auto-Updates Enabled

- **Security**: Get critical security patches immediately
- **Bug Fixes**: Receive stability improvements automatically
- **Features**: Access new features as soon as they're released
- **Compatibility**: Stay compatible with future Lokus ecosystem updates

### Update at Convenient Times

- **Save Your Work**: Always save open notes before updating
- **Close Important Tabs**: Finish critical work before installing updates
- **Restart When Ready**: You can postpone updates to a convenient time

### Monitor Release Notes

- **Check What's New**: Review release notes in update notifications
- **Breaking Changes**: Stay informed about potential breaking changes
- **New Features**: Learn about new capabilities immediately

## Technical Details

### Update Architecture

- **Tauri Plugin**: Built on `@tauri-apps/plugin-updater`
- **Process Manager**: Uses `@tauri-apps/plugin-process` for relaunch
- **Component**: `UpdateChecker.jsx` handles all UI and logic
- **Event System**: Uses custom `check-for-update` browser event

### Version Comparison

- **Semantic Versioning**: Follows semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Pre-Release Support**: Handles alpha, beta, and rc versions
- **Build Metadata**: Ignores build metadata in comparisons

### Download Process

1. Fetches `latest.json` from GitHub releases endpoint
2. Compares remote version with local version
3. Downloads update package if newer version exists
4. Verifies signature and checksum
5. Stages update for installation on restart

## Privacy

<Callout type="info">
Auto-updates respect your privacy:
</Callout>

- **No Tracking**: Update checks don't track user behavior
- **No Analytics**: No data is collected during update process
- **GitHub Only**: All communication is with GitHub's public API
- **Open Source**: The update mechanism is fully transparent and auditable

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the auto-update system:

- **Release Notes Display**: View detailed changelog before updating
- **Selective Updates**: Choose to skip specific versions
- **Beta Channel**: Opt into pre-release versions for testing
- **Update Scheduling**: Set preferred times for update installation
- **Silent Updates**: Install updates without restart prompts (macOS App Store version)

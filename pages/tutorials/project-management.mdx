## Understanding Bases in Lokus

Before we dive in, let's understand what makes Lokus bases powerful for project management.

### What are Bases?

Bases are structured databases that combine the flexibility of notes with the power of databases. Each base contains:

- **Records:** Individual items (tasks, projects, clients)
- **Fields:** Properties of records (status, priority, due date)
- **Views:** Different ways to visualize data (Kanban, table, calendar)
- **Relations:** Connections between bases

> **Note:** 
**Info:** Think of bases as supercharged spreadsheets that integrate seamlessly with your notes and knowledge base.


### Why Bases for Project Management?

- **Structured Data:** Track projects systematically
- **Multiple Views:** See data from different perspectives
- **Custom Fields:** Capture exactly what you need
- **Relational:** Link tasks, projects, and resources
- **Flexible:** Adapt to any project methodology

---

## Step 1: Creating Your First Project Base

Let's create a base to manage tasks.

### 1.1 Create the Tasks Base

1. Open Lokus and create a new workspace or use an existing one
2. Click **"New Base"** (or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + N`)
3. Name it: `Tasks`
4. Choose template: `Project Management - Tasks`
5. Click **"Create"**


### 1.2 Understanding the Default Structure

Your Tasks base comes with these default fields:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Name** | Text | Task title |
| **Status** | Select | Current state |
| **Priority** | Select | Importance level |
| **Due Date** | Date | Deadline |
| **Assignee** | Person | Who's responsible |
| **Notes** | Long Text | Detailed description |

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** Start with the default template and customize as you discover your needs. Don't over-engineer from the start.


### 1.3 Add Custom Fields

Let's add fields specific to your workflow:

1. Click the **"+"** button in the header row
2. Add these fields:
   - **Effort** (Number): Estimated hours
   - **Tags** (Multi-select): Categories like #bug, #feature, #docs
   - **Progress** (Progress bar): % complete
   - **Project** (Relation): Links to Projects base (we'll create this next)

```
Field Configuration Examples:

Effort:
- Type: Number
- Format: Decimal
- Suffix: "hours"

Progress:
- Type: Progress
- Min: 0
- Max: 100
- Show as percentage

Tags:
- Type: Multi-select
- Options: bug, feature, enhancement, docs, testing, design
- Color-coded
```


---

## Step 2: Creating a Kanban View

Now let's visualize our tasks as a Kanban board.

### 2.1 Create the Kanban View

1. In your Tasks base, click **"Add View"**
2. Select **"Kanban"**
3. Name it: `Task Board`
4. Group by: `Status`
5. Click **"Create"**

You should now see columns for each status:
- **Backlog**
- **To Do**
- **In Progress**
- **Review**
- **Done**

### 2.2 Customize Kanban Columns

Let's configure the columns:

1. Click the column header menu (⋮)
2. Customize each column:

```
Backlog:
- Color: Gray
- Limit: None
- Description: "Ideas and future tasks"

To Do:
- Color: Blue
- Limit: 10
- Description: "Ready to start"

In Progress:
- Color: Yellow
- Limit: 3 (WIP limit)
- Description: "Currently working on"

Review:
- Color: Orange
- Limit: 5
- Description: "Needs review/testing"

Done:
- Color: Green
- Limit: None
- Description: "Completed tasks"
```

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** WIP (Work In Progress) limits prevent team overload. Limit "In Progress" to 2-3 tasks per team member.


### 2.3 Add Your First Tasks

Create some example tasks:

**Task 1:**
```
Name: Design new homepage
Status: To Do
Priority: High
Due Date: 2024-01-25
Assignee: Alex
Effort: 8 hours
Tags: design, frontend
Progress: 0%
Notes:
- Mockups needed
- Should match brand guidelines
- Mobile-first approach
```

**Task 2:**
```
Name: Implement user authentication
Status: In Progress
Priority: High
Due Date: 2024-01-20
Assignee: Jordan
Effort: 16 hours
Tags: feature, backend, security
Progress: 60%
Notes:
- OAuth integration
- JWT tokens
- Password reset flow
```

**Task 3:**
```
Name: Write API documentation
Status: Backlog
Priority: Medium
Due Date: 2024-02-01
Assignee: Sam
Effort: 12 hours
Tags: docs
Progress: 0%
```

Drag tasks between columns to change their status!


---

## Step 3: Creating a Projects Base

Let's create a higher-level Projects base to organize tasks.

### 3.1 Create the Projects Base

1. Create a new base: `Projects`
2. Use template: `Project Management - Projects`
3. Add these fields:

```
Field Structure:

Name: Text (Project title)
Status: Select (Planning, Active, On Hold, Completed, Archived)
Owner: Person (Project lead)
Start Date: Date
End Date: Date
Budget: Number (Currency format)
Progress: Formula (Calculated from linked tasks)
Description: Long Text
Health: Select (On Track, At Risk, Blocked)
Tasks: Relation (Links to Tasks base)
```

### 3.2 Link Projects and Tasks

Now connect the bases:

1. In the **Projects** base, create a relation field:
   - Name: `Tasks`
   - Relation type: One project → Many tasks
   - Linked base: `Tasks`

2. In the **Tasks** base, you'll now see:
   - Field: `Project` (automatically created)
   - Links tasks to their parent project

### 3.3 Create Example Projects

**Project 1: Website Redesign**
```
Name: Website Redesign
Status: Active
Owner: Alex
Start Date: 2024-01-15
End Date: 2024-03-31
Budget: $25,000
Health: On Track
Description:
Complete redesign of company website including:
- New visual design
- Improved UX
- Mobile optimization
- Performance improvements

Linked Tasks:
- Design new homepage
- Implement responsive layout
- Optimize images
- Write new copy
```

**Project 2: API v2.0 Development**
```
Name: API v2.0 Development
Status: Active
Owner: Jordan
Start Date: 2024-01-01
End Date: 2024-04-30
Budget: $50,000
Health: At Risk
Description:
Next generation API with:
- RESTful design
- GraphQL endpoint
- Comprehensive documentation
- Rate limiting

Linked Tasks:
- Implement user authentication
- Write API documentation
- Set up rate limiting
- Create integration tests
```

> **Note:** 
**Success:** You now have a two-level project hierarchy! Projects contain tasks, and both are tracked in dedicated bases.


---

## Step 4: Creating Multiple Views

Different views help you see your projects from different angles.

### 4.1 Table View for Detailed Management

In the Tasks base:

1. Create a new view: **"All Tasks"**
2. Type: `Table`
3. Configure columns:
   - Show: All fields
   - Sort: Due Date (ascending)
   - Group: None
4. Add filters:
   - Status is not "Done"

This view is great for detailed task management and bulk editing.

### 4.2 Calendar View for Timeline

1. Create a new view: **"Task Calendar"**
2. Type: `Calendar`
3. Date field: `Due Date`
4. Color by: `Priority`

Now you can see all tasks on a timeline and identify scheduling conflicts.


### 4.3 Timeline View for Gantt Chart

1. Create a new view: **"Project Timeline"**
2. Type: `Timeline` (Gantt)
3. Start date: `Start Date`
4. End date: `Due Date`
5. Group by: `Project`

Perfect for seeing project phases and dependencies.

### 4.4 Board View by Priority

1. Create a new view: **"By Priority"**
2. Type: `Kanban`
3. Group by: `Priority`
4. Columns: High, Medium, Low

Use this to focus on what matters most.

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** Create views for different contexts: "My Tasks" (filtered by assignee), "This Week" (due date filter), "Blocked" (health status), etc.


---

## Step 5: Task Dependencies and Relationships

Let's set up task dependencies to track what blocks what.

### 5.1 Add Dependency Fields

In the Tasks base, add:

1. **Blocks** (Relation to Tasks):
   - This task blocks other tasks
2. **Blocked By** (Relation to Tasks):
   - This task is blocked by other tasks

### 5.2 Create Dependent Tasks

Example workflow:

```
Task: Design homepage mockups
↓ Blocks
Task: Implement homepage layout
↓ Blocks
Task: Write homepage copy
↓ Blocks
Task: Deploy homepage
```

Set up the relationships:

1. Open "Implement homepage layout"
2. In **Blocked By** field, link: "Design homepage mockups"
3. The reverse relationship auto-updates!

### 5.3 Create a Dependencies View

1. New view: **"Dependencies"**
2. Type: `Table`
3. Show columns: Name, Status, Blocks, Blocked By
4. Filter: Show only tasks that block or are blocked
5. Conditional formatting:
   - Highlight tasks blocked by incomplete tasks (red)
   - Highlight tasks blocking others (yellow)

> **Note:** 
**Warning:** Too many dependencies create complexity. Use them for critical path items only.


---

## Step 6: Milestones and Sprints

Let's add sprint planning capabilities.

### 6.1 Create a Sprints Base

1. New base: `Sprints`
2. Fields:

```
Sprint Structure:

Name: Text (e.g., "Sprint 12")
Number: Number (12)
Goal: Long Text (Sprint objective)
Start Date: Date
End Date: Date
Status: Select (Planning, Active, Complete)
Tasks: Relation (Links to Tasks)
Capacity: Number (Total team hours)
Velocity: Formula (Completed story points)
```

### 6.2 Create a Milestones Base

1. New base: `Milestones`
2. Fields:

```
Milestone Structure:

Name: Text (e.g., "MVP Launch")
Date: Date (Target date)
Status: Select (Upcoming, At Risk, Achieved, Missed)
Project: Relation (Links to Projects)
Tasks: Relation (Links to Tasks)
Completion: Formula (% of linked tasks done)
Description: Long Text
```

### 6.3 Link Everything Together

Now your system has this structure:

```
Projects
  ├── Contains multiple Tasks
  ├── Contains multiple Milestones
  └── Tracked across multiple Sprints

Sprints
  ├── Contains multiple Tasks
  └── Contributes to Milestones

Milestones
  ├── Belongs to a Project
  └── Comprises multiple Tasks
```

> **Note:** 
**Info:** This relational structure provides incredible flexibility. View data from any angle: by project, by sprint, by milestone, by person.


---

## Step 7: Team Collaboration Features

Let's set up collaboration workflows.

### 7.1 Add Collaboration Fields

Enhance your Tasks base:

```
New Fields:

Comments: Long Text (Discussion thread)
Watchers: Multi-person (Who's following this)
Last Updated: Last Modified Time
Updated By: Last Modified By
Attachments: Files (Screenshots, docs)
Links: URL (External resources)
```

### 7.2 Create Team Views

**View: My Tasks**
- Filter: Assignee is [Current User]
- Sort: Priority, then Due Date
- Personal dashboard for each team member

**View: Team Board**
- Type: Kanban
- Group by: Assignee
- See what everyone is working on

**View: This Week**
- Filter: Due Date is this week
- Sort: Priority
- Focus on immediate deadlines

**View: Overdue**
- Filter: Due Date is before today AND Status is not Done
- Sort: Due Date (oldest first)
- Conditional formatting: Red highlight

### 7.3 Set Up Notifications

Configure base settings:

1. Click base settings ()
2. Go to **Notifications**
3. Enable:
   - Task assigned to me
   - Task due tomorrow
   - Task blocked by incomplete task
   - Comments on my tasks
   - Changes to tasks I'm watching


---

## Step 8: Automation and Formulas

Let's automate repetitive tasks.

### 8.1 Formula Fields

Add calculated fields to Projects base:

**Progress Formula:**
```javascript
// Calculate project progress from linked tasks
if (empty(prop("Tasks"))) {
  return 0
}

let tasks = prop("Tasks")
let completed = tasks.filter(t => t.prop("Status") == "Done").length
return (completed / tasks.length) * 100
```

**Days Remaining:**
```javascript
// Calculate days until deadline
let endDate = prop("End Date")
let today = now()
return dateBetween(endDate, today, "days")
```

**Budget Status:**
```javascript
// Show budget health
let spent = prop("Spent")
let budget = prop("Budget")
let percentage = (spent / budget) * 100

if (percentage > 90) {
  return "Over Budget"
} else if (percentage > 75) {
  return "Watch Budget"
} else {
  return "On Budget"
}
```

### 8.2 Automation Rules

Set up automated actions:

**Auto-assign to Project Lead:**
```
When: New task created in project
Action: Set assignee to project owner
```

**Auto-move to Review:**
```
When: Task progress reaches 100%
Action: Change status to "Review"
```

**Notify on Block:**
```
When: Task is marked as blocked
Action: Notify assignee and project owner
```

**Weekly Summary:**
```
When: Every Friday at 4 PM
Action: Generate weekly report with:
  - Tasks completed
  - Tasks in progress
  - Blockers
  - Next week priorities
```

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** Start with simple automations. Add complexity only when manual processes become painful.


---

## Step 9: Reports and Dashboards

Create dashboards to track project health.

### 9.1 Create a Dashboard Base

1. New base: `Dashboard`
2. Use it to aggregate metrics from other bases

### 9.2 Key Metrics to Track

**Project Metrics:**
- Active projects count
- Projects at risk
- Average project progress
- Budget utilization

**Task Metrics:**
- Total tasks
- Tasks by status
- Tasks by priority
- Overdue tasks
- Tasks completed this week
- Average task completion time

**Team Metrics:**
- Tasks per team member
- Workload distribution
- Team velocity (tasks/week)
- Blocked tasks

### 9.3 Visualization Options

**Embed Views:**
```markdown
# Project Dashboard

## Active Projects
<embed-view base="Projects" view="Active Projects">

## Task Distribution
<embed-view base="Tasks" view="By Status">

## This Week
<embed-view base="Tasks" view="This Week">
```

**Charts and Graphs:**
- Pie chart: Tasks by status
- Bar chart: Tasks by assignee
- Line chart: Velocity over time
- Burn-down chart: Sprint progress

## Tips for Success

### Do's

**Start Simple:** Begin with basic task tracking, add complexity as needed

**Consistent Updates:** Make updating tasks part of your daily routine

**Clear Naming:** Use descriptive task and project names

**Link Liberally:** Connect related tasks, projects, and notes

**Review Regularly:** Weekly reviews keep the system clean and current

**Customize Views:** Create views for different contexts and users

**Use Templates:** Standardize recurring project types

### Don'ts

 **Over-complicate:** Don't create fields and views you won't use

 **Ignore Dependencies:** Track critical path items to avoid delays

 **Skip Reviews:** Stale data makes the system useless

 **Work in Silos:** Share information with your team

 **Forget to Archive:** Old projects clutter your workspace

 **Rely Solely on Tools:** Communication still matters

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My board is too cluttered"

**Solution:** Use filters and multiple views. Create focused views like "My Tasks This Week" instead of showing everything.

### "Tasks are falling through the cracks"

**Solution:**
- Set up automated reminders for due dates
- Create an "Overdue" view
- Review unassigned tasks weekly

### "Team isn't updating task status"

**Solution:**
- Make it part of daily standup
- Show how data helps the team (not just management)
- Reduce friction with templates and defaults

### "Can't see the big picture"

**Solution:**
- Create dashboard with high-level metrics
- Use timeline view for Gantt perspective
- Maintain project-level summary notes

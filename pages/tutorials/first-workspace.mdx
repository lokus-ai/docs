# Building Your First Workspace

Welcome to Lokus! In this tutorial, you'll create your first knowledge base and learn the fundamentals of organizing information in Lokus.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Create and configure a new workspace
- Add and format notes using markdown
- Link notes together to build connections
- Organize notes with tags and folders
- Use basic search and navigation
- Understand the Lokus interface and core concepts

## Prerequisites

- Lokus installed on your system
- Basic familiarity with markdown (helpful but not required)
- 20 minutes of focused time

## Time Estimate

**20 minutes** - Perfect for a lunch break!

---

## Step 1: Creating Your Workspace

Let's start by creating your first workspace. Think of a workspace as a container for a specific area of knowledge.

### 1.1 Launch Lokus

Open Lokus on your system. You should see the welcome screen.


### 1.2 Create a New Workspace

1. Click the **"New Workspace"** button
2. Enter a name: `My Knowledge Base`
3. Choose a location on your computer to store the workspace
4. Click **"Create"**

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** Use descriptive workspace names like "Personal Wiki", "Work Projects", or "Learning Notes" to distinguish multiple workspaces later.


### 1.3 Understand the Interface

You should now see the main Lokus interface with three panels:

- **Left Sidebar:** Navigation, folders, and tags
- **Center Panel:** Your notes list and editor
- **Right Sidebar:** Note metadata, backlinks, and graph view


> **Note:** 
**Success:** Your workspace is created! You're now looking at an empty knowledge base ready to be filled.


---

## Step 2: Creating Your First Note

Now let's add some content to your workspace.

### 2.1 Create a Note

1. Click the **"New Note"** button (or press `Cmd/Ctrl + N`)
2. You'll see a blank note with an untitled header
3. Click on "Untitled" and rename it to: `Welcome to My Knowledge Base`

### 2.2 Add Content

Copy and paste the following into your note:

```markdown
# Welcome to My Knowledge Base

This is my first note in Lokus!

## Why I'm Using Lokus

I want to build a personal knowledge management system to:
- Organize my thoughts and ideas
- Track what I'm learning
- Build connections between concepts
- Never forget important information

## What I'll Track Here

- Book notes and summaries
- Project ideas
- Daily reflections
- Technical learnings
```

### 2.3 Understanding Markdown

Lokus uses markdown for formatting. Here are the basics:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text**
*Italic text*

- Bullet point
1. Numbered list

[Link text](URL)
![Image](image-url)
```

> **Note:** 
**Info:** Lokus supports full markdown syntax plus additional features like wikilinks, which we'll explore next.


### 2.4 Save Your Note

Lokus auto-saves, but you can manually save with `Cmd/Ctrl + S`. Notice the note now appears in your notes list on the left.


---

## Step 3: Creating Linked Notes

The real power of Lokus comes from linking notes together. Let's create a network of connected notes.

### 3.1 Create a Note About Books

1. Create a new note (`Cmd/Ctrl + N`)
2. Title it: `Books I Want to Read`
3. Add this content:

```markdown
# Books I Want to Read

## Non-Fiction
- Atomic Habits by James Clear
- How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens
- Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte

## Fiction
- Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir
- The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin

---

Related: [[Reading Notes]]
```

### 3.2 Understanding Wikilinks

Notice the `[[Reading Notes]]` syntax? This is a **wikilink** - Lokus's way of linking notes together.

When you type `[[`, Lokus will show an autocomplete menu of existing notes. If the note doesn't exist yet, Lokus will create it when you click the link.

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** Use `[[` to start typing a link, then press `Tab` or click to select from the autocomplete menu. This ensures you're linking to the right note.


### 3.3 Create the Linked Note

1. Click on the `[[Reading Notes]]` link you just created
2. Lokus creates a new note called "Reading Notes"
3. Add this content:

```markdown
# Reading Notes

This is where I'll collect notes from books I read.

## Current Reading

Working on: [[Atomic Habits]]

## Reading Strategy

1. Read with intention
2. Take notes while reading
3. Review and summarize after finishing
4. Connect ideas to existing knowledge

---

Back to: [[Books I Want to Read]]
```

### 3.4 Create a Book Note

Now click on `[[Atomic Habits]]` to create another note:

```markdown
# Atomic Habits

**Author:** James Clear
**Status:** Currently Reading
**Started:** 2024-01-15

## Key Concepts

### The Four Laws of Behavior Change

1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy
4. Make it satisfying

## My Takeaways

The idea that small habits compound over time is powerful. Instead of trying to change everything at once, focus on tiny improvements.

## Quotes

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

Related: [[Habits]], [[Personal Development]], [[Reading Notes]]
```

> **Note:** 
**Success:** You've created your first network of linked notes! Notice how each note references others, creating a web of knowledge.


---

## Step 4: Organizing with Tags and Folders

Let's organize our notes using tags and folders.

### 4.1 Adding Tags

Tags are a flexible way to categorize notes. Add tags to your "Atomic Habits" note:

```markdown
---
tags: [books, habits, personal-development, non-fiction]
---

# Atomic Habits
...
```

The frontmatter (content between `---` markers) stores metadata about your note.

### 4.2 Create Folders

1. Right-click in the left sidebar
2. Select **"New Folder"**
3. Name it: `Books`
4. Drag your book-related notes into this folder

Create another folder called `Meta` for organizational notes like "Welcome to My Knowledge Base".


> **Note:** 
**Warning:** Folders are great for organization, but don't rely on them exclusively. Links and tags create more flexible connections between ideas.


### 4.3 Understanding Organization Strategies

Lokus supports multiple organization methods:

| Method | Best For | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Folders** | Broad categories | Books/, Projects/, Journal/ |
| **Tags** | Cross-cutting themes | #important, #todo, #idea |
| **Links** | Semantic connections | "X relates to Y" |

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** Use all three methods together. Folders for structure, tags for attributes, and links for relationships.


---

## Step 5: Navigation and Search

Now that you have several notes, let's learn how to find information quickly.

### 5.1 Quick Switcher

The fastest way to navigate is the Quick Switcher:

1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + P`
2. Start typing a note name
3. Press Enter to open the note


### 5.2 Tag Browser

To see all notes with a specific tag:

1. Open the left sidebar
2. Click on the **"Tags"** section
3. Click on any tag to see all notes with that tag

### 5.3 Basic Search

Try the search function:

1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + F` for quick search
2. Or use the search bar at the top
3. Type: `habits`
4. See all notes containing that word

### 5.4 Backlinks Panel

Open any note and look at the right sidebar. The **"Backlinks"** section shows all notes that link to the current note.

For example, open "Reading Notes" and you'll see "Books I Want to Read" listed as a backlink.

> **Note:** 
**Info:** Backlinks are automatic - you don't need to maintain them. They update whenever you add or remove links.


---

## Step 6: Visualizing Connections

Let's explore the graph view to see your knowledge network.

### 6.1 Open Graph View

1. Look for the **"Graph"** icon in the right sidebar
2. Click it to see a visual representation of your notes
3. Each circle is a note, lines show connections


### 6.2 Interact with the Graph

- **Hover** over nodes to see note names
- **Click** nodes to open that note
- **Drag** nodes to rearrange the layout
- **Zoom** with mouse wheel or pinch gesture

### 6.3 Local vs. Global Graph

- **Local Graph:** Shows connections for the current note only
- **Global Graph:** Shows all notes and connections in your workspace

Toggle between views using the controls in the graph panel.

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** The graph view is great for discovering unexpected connections and identifying orphaned notes (notes with no links).

## Step 7: Building Your Knowledge System

Now that you know the basics, let's establish good habits for growing your knowledge base.

### 7.1 Daily Notes

Create a new note called `2024-01-15 Daily` (use today's date):

```markdown
# January 15, 2024

## What I Did Today
- Set up my first Lokus workspace
- Created notes about books I want to read
- Learned about linking and organization

## Ideas
- Start taking notes while reading books
- Create a template for book notes
- Maybe track daily habits here?

## Links to Explore
- [[Habit Tracking]]
- [[Daily Review Process]]

---

Yesterday: [[2024-01-14 Daily]] | Tomorrow: [[2024-01-16 Daily]]
```

### 7.2 Index Notes

Create a note called `Home` as your workspace homepage:

```markdown
# Home

Welcome to my knowledge base! Start here to navigate my notes.

## Quick Links

- [[Books I Want to Read]]
- [[Reading Notes]]
- Daily Notes: [[2024-01-15 Daily]]

## Categories

- [[Books/]] - Book notes and reading lists
- [[Projects/]] - Project documentation
- [[Learning/]] - Things I'm learning

## Recent Thoughts

- The power of linked notes is amazing
- Need to develop a consistent note-taking workflow
- Excited to build this system over time
```

> **Note:** 
**Info:** Index notes (also called MOCs - Maps of Content) are hub notes that link to many related notes. They're great entry points for exploring topics.


### 7.3 Note-Taking Best Practices

As you grow your knowledge base, follow these principles:

1. **Atomic Notes:** One idea per note
2. **Descriptive Titles:** Make titles searchable and clear
3. **Link Generously:** Create connections between related ideas
4. **Review Regularly:** Revisit notes to strengthen memory
5. **Refactor Often:** Reorganize as your understanding grows

---

## Step 8: Customizing Your Workspace

Let's personalize your workspace settings.

### 8.1 Workspace Settings

1. Click the gear icon or go to Settings
2. Navigate to **"Workspace Settings"**
3. Customize:
   - Default note location
   - Auto-save frequency
   - Link format preferences
   - Theme (light/dark mode)

### 8.2 Editor Preferences

Configure the editor to your liking:

- **Line numbers:** On/Off
- **Spell check:** Enable for writing
- **Vim mode:** For vim enthusiasts
- **Font size:** Adjust for comfort

### 8.3 Templates

Create a template for book notes:

1. Create a note called `Template - Book Note`
2. Add this content:

```markdown
# [Book Title]

**Author:**
**Status:**
**Started:**
**Finished:**

## Overview

Brief description of the book.

## Key Concepts

Main ideas and concepts from the book.

## My Takeaways

Personal insights and how I'll apply this.

## Quotes

> Notable quotes

## Related

- [[Reading Notes]]
- Tags: #books #
```

Now you can copy this template whenever you start a new book!

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** Create templates for recurring note types: daily notes, meeting notes, project plans, etc. This ensures consistency and saves time.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

Avoid these pitfalls:

###  Over-organizing Too Soon
Don't spend hours creating the perfect folder structure. Start simple and let organization emerge naturally.

###  Not Linking Enough
The power of Lokus comes from connections. When you mention a concept, create a link to it.

###  Making Notes Too Long
Break long notes into smaller, focused notes. Each note should cover one main idea.

###  Being Too Precious
Don't worry about making perfect notes. Lokus is flexible - you can always refactor later.

### Instead, Do This
- Start capturing notes immediately
- Link as you write
- Keep notes atomic and focused
- Review and reorganize regularly

---

## Troubleshooting

### Q: My notes aren't saving
**A:** Check that you have write permissions to the workspace folder. Lokus auto-saves, but verify the status indicator shows "Saved".

### Q: Links aren't working
**A:** Make sure you're using the correct syntax: `[[Note Name]]`. The note name must match exactly (case-sensitive).

### Q: I can't find a note I created
**A:** Use Quick Switcher (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`) or the search function. Check if the note is in a folder you're not currently viewing.

### Q: The graph view is cluttered
**A:** Use filters to show only specific tags or folders. Zoom in on areas of interest.

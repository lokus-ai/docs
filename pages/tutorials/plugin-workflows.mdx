   ```

4. **Dependency Tracking** (Link Explorer)
   - See which tasks block others
   - Visualize project graph

---

## Step 5: Plugin Performance Optimization

Ensure plugins don't slow down Lokus.

### 5.1 Monitor Plugin Performance

1. Open **Command Palette** (Cmd/Ctrl + P)
2. Type "Show Plugin Performance"
3. View metrics:
   - Load time
   - Memory usage
   - CPU usage
   - Event listeners

**Red flags:**
- Load time > 500ms
- Memory usage > 50MB
- High CPU during idle

### 5.2 Optimize Plugin Usage

**Disable Unused Plugins:**
- Settings → Plugins
- Disable plugins you don't actively use
- Keep < 10 plugins enabled for best performance

**Configure Refresh Intervals:**
- Settings → [Plugin Name] → Refresh Interval
- Increase intervals for non-critical plugins
- Disable auto-refresh for static content

**Use Lazy Loading:**
- Settings → Plugins → Advanced
- Enable "Lazy load plugins"
- Plugins load only when needed

**Clear Plugin Caches:**
- Settings → Plugins → Advanced
- Click "Clear All Plugin Caches"
- Do this monthly for best performance

### 5.3 Troubleshooting Plugin Issues

**Plugin won't enable:**
1. Check Lokus version compatibility
2. Look for dependency conflicts
3. Review console for errors (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + I)

**Plugin causing crashes:**
1. Disable via Safe Mode (Hold Shift during startup)
2. Report issue to plugin developer
3. Wait for update or find alternative

**Conflicts between plugins:**
1. Disable plugins one by one
2. Identify which combination causes issue
3. Check plugin documentation for known conflicts

## Best Practices

### Do's

**✓ Start minimal** - Install plugins one at a time

**✓ Read documentation** - Understand capabilities fully

**✓ Configure carefully** - Set up properly before using

**✓ Review permissions** - Know what plugins access

**✓ Keep plugins updated** - Updates include fixes and features

**✓ Backup before experimenting** - Test new plugins safely

**✓ Use plugin presets** - Save configurations for workflows

### Don'ts

**✗ Install everything** - Only install what you need

**✗ Ignore performance** - Monitor plugin impact

**✗ Skip updates** - Old versions have bugs and security issues

**✗ Trust blindly** - Review code and permissions

**✗ Overcomplicate** - Start simple, add complexity gradually

**✗ Ignore conflicts** - Resolve plugin conflicts promptly

---

## Practice Exercise

**Goal:** Build your own productivity workflow

**Task:** Create a morning routine workflow that:
1. Opens today's daily note
2. Shows incomplete tasks from yesterday
3. Displays your top 3 goals
4. Creates a time-blocked schedule
5. Links to active projects

**Steps:**
1. Install required plugins (Daily Notes Pro, Advanced Tasks)
2. Create morning routine template
3. Set up automation rule for 6am creation
4. Test the workflow for 3 days
5. Refine based on what works

**Bonus:** Add Link Explorer to suggest related notes based on your goals.

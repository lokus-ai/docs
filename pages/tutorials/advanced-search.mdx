## Understanding Lokus Search

Before diving into advanced features, let's understand how search works.

### Search Architecture

Lokus uses a multi-layered search system:

1. **Quick Search:** Fast text matching (Cmd/Ctrl + F)
2. **Full-Text Search:** Comprehensive content search
3. **Quantum Search:** Fuzzy matching with AI-powered relevance
4. **Metadata Search:** Search properties and frontmatter
5. **Structured Search:** Query bases and structured data

### Search Index

Lokus maintains a search index that updates in real-time:

- **Content:** All note text content
- **Metadata:** Frontmatter, tags, properties
- **Links:** Wikilinks and backlinks
- **Structure:** Headings, lists, tables
- **Files:** File names and paths

> **Note:** 
**Info:** The search index rebuilds automatically when you add, edit, or delete notes. Large workspaces may take a few seconds to reindex.


---

## Step 1: Basic Search Operators

Let's start with fundamental search operators.

### 1.1 Text Search

**Simple word search:**
```
habit
```
Finds notes containing "habit"

**Phrase search (exact match):**
```
"atomic habits"
```
Finds exact phrase "atomic habits"

**Multiple words (AND):**
```
habit building
```
Finds notes containing both "habit" AND "building"

### 1.2 Boolean Operators

**OR operator:**
```
habit OR routine
```
Finds notes containing either word

**NOT operator:**
```
habit -routine
```
Finds "habit" but excludes notes with "routine"

**Complex combinations:**
```
(habit OR routine) AND building -productivity
```
Finds notes about habit/routine building, excluding productivity

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** Use parentheses to control operator precedence, just like math: `(A OR B) AND C` is different from `A OR (B AND C)`.


### 1.3 Wildcard Search

**Asterisk wildcard (*):**
```
habit*
```
Matches: habit, habits, habitual, habitually

**Question mark wildcard (?):**
```
wom?n
```
Matches: woman, women

**Multiple wildcards:**
```
habit* AND build*
```
Matches: habits building, habitual builder, etc.


---

## Step 2: Field-Specific Search

Search within specific note properties.

### 2.1 Common Fields

**Title search:**
```
title:"project management"
```
Searches only in note titles

**Content search:**
```
content:zettelkasten
```
Searches only in note content (excludes titles, metadata)

**Tag search:**
```
tag:habits
tag:#productivity
```
Finds notes with specific tags

**Path search:**
```
path:Projects/
```
Finds notes in specific folder

### 2.2 Metadata Search

**Date created:**
```
created:2024-01-15
created:>2024-01-01
created:&lt;2024-02-01
```

**Date modified:**
```
modified:today
modified:yesterday
modified:this-week
modified:>7days
```

**Author search:**
```
author:"John Doe"
```

**Custom fields:**
```
status:active
priority:high
project:"Website Redesign"
```

### 2.3 Combining Field Searches

```
tag:habits AND created:>2024-01-01 AND title:atomic
```
Finds habit-tagged notes created this year with "atomic" in title

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** Use field searches to quickly filter large result sets. Start broad, then add field constraints to narrow down.


---

## Step 3: Advanced Operators

Powerful operators for precise queries.

### 3.1 Proximity Search

**NEAR operator:**
```
habit NEAR building
habit NEAR/5 building
```
Finds "habit" and "building" near each other (within 5 words)

**BEFORE/AFTER:**
```
system BEFORE thinking
cause AFTER effect
```
Finds words in specific order

### 3.2 Numeric Operators

**Greater than/less than:**
```
wordcount:>1000
wordcount:&lt;500
wordcount:500..2000
```

**Exact match:**
```
wordcount:1500
```

**Range:**
```
created:[2024-01-01 TO 2024-01-31]
priority:[1 TO 5]
```

### 3.3 Special Operators

**Has operator:**
```
has:tag
has:backlinks
has:frontmatter
has:image
has:code
has:table
```

**Is operator:**
```
is:favorite
is:pinned
is:archived
is:unlinked
is:orphan
```

**Count operator:**
```
backlinks:>10
links:5
tags:>3
```

### 3.4 Fuzzy Search

**Tilde (~) for fuzzy matching:**
```
habbit~
```
Matches: habit (allows 1 edit distance)

**Custom edit distance:**
```
habbit~2
```
Allows up to 2 character differences


---

## Step 4: Regular Expressions

Use regex for pattern-based searching.

### 4.1 Basic Regex

**Enable regex mode:**
```
/pattern/
```

**Common patterns:**
```
/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/        # Dates: 2024-01-15
/[A-Z]{2,}/                 # Acronyms: API, REST, CRUD
/https?:\/\/[^\s]+/         # URLs
/\b[A-Z][a-z]+\b/          # Capitalized words
```

### 4.2 Practical Regex Searches

**Find TODO items:**
```
/- \[ \] .+/
```

**Find headers:**
```
/^#{1,6}\s.+$/
```

**Find email addresses:**
```
/[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w+/
```

**Find wikilinks:**
```
/\[\[[^\]]+\]\]/
```

**Find phone numbers:**
```
/\(?\d{3}\)?[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}/
```

### 4.3 Regex with Field Search

Combine regex with field operators:

```
title:/Project \d+/
content:/TODO|FIXME|HACK/
tag:/^dev-.*/
```

> **Note:** 
**Warning:** Complex regex patterns can slow down search. Test on small result sets first, then expand.

## Step 5: Quantum Search

Lokus's AI-powered semantic search.

### 5.1 What is Quantum Search?

Quantum Search uses machine learning to find semantically related content, not just keyword matches.

**Traditional search:**
```
habit building
```
Finds notes containing those exact words

**Quantum search:**
```
~habit building
```
Finds notes about: habits, routines, behavior change, consistency, discipline, etc.

### 5.2 Semantic Queries

**Concept search:**
```
~learning effectively
```
Finds: study techniques, memory, spaced repetition, note-taking methods

**Question search:**
```
~how to stay motivated?
```
Finds relevant answers even if question isn't explicitly stated

**Context search:**
```
~productivity in remote work
```
Understands context and finds related concepts

### 5.3 Similarity Search

**Find similar notes:**
```
similar:[[Note Title]]
```
Finds notes similar to the specified note

**Find related:**
```
related:current
```
Finds notes related to currently open note

### 5.4 Quantum Search Settings

Configure in Settings → Search → Quantum:

- **Sensitivity:** How loosely to match (0-100)
- **Context window:** How much text to consider
- **Relevance threshold:** Minimum match score
- **Max results:** Limit quantum results

> **Note:** 
**Info:** Quantum search requires an active internet connection and processes queries server-side for privacy-respecting AI analysis.

## Step 6: Search Filters

Narrow results with powerful filters.

### 6.1 Quick Filters

**Filter panel** (click funnel icon in search):

- **File type:** Notes, Images, PDFs, All
- **Date range:** Today, This week, This month, Custom
- **Tags:** Select from tag list
- **Folder:** Select from folder tree
- **Has property:** Frontmatter, Tags, Links, etc.

### 6.2 Saved Filters

Create reusable filter combinations:

1. Build your search query
2. Apply desired filters
3. Click **"Save Filter"**
4. Name it: "Recent Project Notes"

**Example saved filters:**

```
Name: Active Projects
Query: tag:project AND status:active AND modified:>30days

Name: Unlinked Notes
Query: is:orphan AND created:>7days

Name: High Priority Tasks
Query: tag:todo AND priority:high AND due:&lt;7days

Name: Long Form Content
Query: wordcount:>2000 AND tag:writing
```

### 6.3 Filter Combinations

Stack filters for precise results:

```
Base query: productivity
+ Filter: tag:habits
+ Filter: created:this-month
+ Filter: has:backlinks
+ Sort: modified (newest first)
```

## Step 10: Search Performance Optimization

Make searches faster and more efficient.

### 10.1 Query Optimization

**Do:**
- ✅ Use field searches to narrow scope
- ✅ Put most restrictive terms first
- ✅ Use exact phrases when possible
- ✅ Limit wildcard usage

**Don't:**
- ❌ Start queries with wildcards (`*term`)
- ❌ Use too many OR operators
- ❌ Over-use regex for simple searches
- ❌ Search without any constraints

### 10.2 Index Management

**Reindex workspace:**
```
Settings → Search → Rebuild Index
```

When to reindex:
- After importing many notes
- If search results seem incorrect
- After major Lokus updates
- Monthly maintenance

### 10.3 Search Settings

**Optimize in Settings → Search:**

- **Index depth:** Balance speed vs. completeness
- **Cache size:** More cache = faster repeated searches
- **Async indexing:** Index in background
- **Excluded folders:** Don't index archives

### 10.4 Performance Tips

**Large workspaces (>10,000 notes):**

1. Use specific field searches
2. Search within folders
3. Exclude archived content
4. Use saved searches
5. Enable async indexing
6. Increase cache size

**Example optimized search:**
```
# Slow (searches everything)
productivity

# Fast (narrow scope)
path:"Active Projects/" AND tag:productivity AND modified:>30days
```

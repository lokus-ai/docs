## Step 2: Ideation and Idea Capture

### 2.1 Create an Idea Capture Template

In `6-Templates/`, create:

```markdown
# Content Idea Template

[One sentence: What is this about?]

## Why This Matters

## Potential Formats

- [ ] Tweet thread (8-10 tweets)
- [ ] Newsletter (800 words)
- [ ] Video (10-15 minutes)
- [ ] Infographic
- [ ] Podcast episode

## SEO Keywords

- Primary: [main keyword]
- Secondary: [related keywords]

- [ ] [Examples to find]

## Related Content

## Estimated Effort

**Time:** [Hours]

---

**Status:** Raw Idea
**Created:** [Date]
**Tags:** #idea #[topic] #[platform]
```

### 2.2 Quick Capture for On-the-Go Ideas

Create a simplified capture template:

```markdown
# [Idea Title]

**One-liner:** [Explain in one sentence]

**Why interesting:** [One sentence]

**Format:** [Blog/Social/Video/etc.]

**Priority:** [High/Med/Low]

---

Process later ↓
- [ ] Expand into full idea template
- [ ] Add to Content Ideas base
- [ ] Schedule for planning session
```

### 2.3 Idea Sources to Track

Create a note tracking where ideas come from:

```markdown
# Content Idea Sources

## Audience Questions
- Comments on existing content
- DMs and emails
- Community forum questions
- Q&A sessions

## Industry Trends

## Repurposing

- Series → eBook

---

**Goal:** Capture 3-5 ideas per week from diverse sources
```

### 2.4 Idea Validation Process

Create a validation checklist:

```markdown
# Idea Validation Checklist

For each idea, ask:

## Audience Fit
- [ ] Is this relevant to my target audience?
- [ ] Does this solve a real problem or answer a question?
- [ ] Will they care about this topic?

- [ ] If not, can I gain it through research?
- [ ] Is this in my content niche?

## SEO Potential
- [ ] Are people searching for this?
- [ ] Is the competition reasonable?
- [ ] Can I rank for these keywords?

## Differentiation
- [ ] What's my unique angle?
- [ ] How is this different from existing content?
- [ ] Why would someone choose my content over others?

## Resource Check
- [ ] Do I have time to create this well?
- [ ] Do I have needed resources (data, images, etc.)?
- [ ] Is the effort worth the potential impact?

## Strategic Alignment
- [ ] Does this support my content goals?
- [ ] Does it fit my content calendar theme?
- [ ] Does it complement existing content?

If 4+ checks pass → Move to Planning
If 2-3 checks pass → Save for "Maybe Someday"
If 0-1 checks pass → Archive

**Review "Maybe Someday" quarterly**
```

> **Note:** 
**Pro Tip:** Not every idea needs to be content. Some ideas are better as personal notes or private reflections. Be ruthlessly selective.

# Using Block References

Connect specific ideas across your notes with block-level links. Block references let you link to and embed individual paragraphs, headings, list items, or quotes instead of entire notes.

**Time Estimate:** 15 minutes

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Create block IDs for specific content
- Link to individual blocks within notes
- Embed block content in other notes
- Use block references for precise knowledge management
- Apply block references to real-world use cases

## Prerequisites

- Lokus v1.3.4 or later
- Basic familiarity with wiki links (`[[note]]` syntax)
- Understanding of note-taking fundamentals
- 15 minutes of focused time

---

<Steps>

### Step 1: Understanding Block References

Before we dive in, let's understand what block references are and why they're powerful.

#### What is a Block?

In Lokus, a **block** is any distinct unit of content:
- A paragraph
- A heading
- A list item
- A blockquote
- A code block
- A table row

#### What is a Block Reference?

A **block reference** links to a specific block within a note, not the entire note. This enables granular connections between ideas.

**Regular wiki link:**
```
[[Book Notes]]
```
Links to the entire note.

**Block reference:**
```
[[Book Notes^a3x9k2m4]]
```
Links to a specific paragraph or section within "Book Notes".

#### Why Use Block References?

1. **Precision:** Link to specific quotes or ideas
2. **Granularity:** Build connections at the atomic level
3. **Reusability:** Reference the same insight across multiple notes
4. **Context:** Preserve the original context when embedding

> **Note:**
**Info:** Block references are compatible with Obsidian's syntax, making your notes portable across tools.


---

### Step 2: Creating Your First Block ID

Let's create a note and add block IDs to specific content.

#### 2.1 Create a Test Note

1. Create a new note called `Book - Atomic Habits`
2. Add this content:

```markdown
# Atomic Habits by James Clear

## Key Concepts

### 1% Better Every Day

The compound effect of tiny improvements is remarkable. Getting 1% better each day leads to being 37 times better after one year.

The math: 1.01^365 = 37.78

This isn't just theory - it applies to skills, habits, and knowledge.

### The Four Laws of Behavior Change

1. Make it obvious (Cue)
2. Make it attractive (Craving)
3. Make it easy (Response)
4. Make it satisfying (Reward)

### Environment Design

Environment is the invisible hand that shapes behavior. Don't rely on willpower alone.

Example: If you want to read more, place books where you'll see them.
```

#### 2.2 Add a Block ID

To create a block ID, simply add `^blockid` at the end of any block:

```markdown
The compound effect of tiny improvements is remarkable. Getting 1% better each day leads to being 37 times better after one year. ^compound-effect
```

The syntax is: `content ^your-block-id`

**Block ID Rules:**
- 8 alphanumeric characters (Lokus can auto-generate)
- Use `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, hyphens, and underscores
- Place at the end of the block
- Space before the `^` symbol

#### 2.3 Let's Add More Block IDs

Update your note:

```markdown
# Atomic Habits by James Clear

## Key Concepts

### 1% Better Every Day

The compound effect of tiny improvements is remarkable. Getting 1% better each day leads to being 37 times better after one year. ^compound-effect

The math: 1.01^365 = 37.78 ^compound-math

This isn't just theory - it applies to skills, habits, and knowledge. ^compound-application

### The Four Laws of Behavior Change

1. Make it obvious (Cue) ^law-1
2. Make it attractive (Craving) ^law-2
3. Make it easy (Response) ^law-3
4. Make it satisfying (Reward) ^law-4

### Environment Design

Environment is the invisible hand that shapes behavior. Don't rely on willpower alone. ^environment-power

Example: If you want to read more, place books where you'll see them. ^environment-example
```

> **Note:**
**Pro Tip:** Use descriptive block IDs like `^compound-effect` instead of random characters like `^a3x9k2m4`. They're easier to remember and make your links more meaningful.


---

### Step 3: Linking to Specific Blocks

Now let's create links to these blocks from another note.

#### 3.1 Create a New Note

Create a note called `Personal Development Ideas`

#### 3.2 Link to Blocks

Use the syntax: `[[Note Name^block-id]]`

```markdown
# Personal Development Ideas

## Habits & Systems

The key to improvement is consistency, not intensity.

**Key insight:** [[Book - Atomic Habits^compound-effect]]

The mathematical proof shows that small daily improvements compound dramatically: [[Book - Atomic Habits^compound-math]]

## My Habit Building Framework

Based on James Clear's research:

1. [[Book - Atomic Habits^law-1]]
2. [[Book - Atomic Habits^law-2]]
3. [[Book - Atomic Habits^law-3]]
4. [[Book - Atomic Habits^law-4]]

## Environment Optimization

[[Book - Atomic Habits^environment-power]]

Practical application: [[Book - Atomic Habits^environment-example]]
```

#### 3.3 How Block Links Work

When you click a block reference link:
- Lokus opens the target note
- Automatically scrolls to the specific block
- Highlights the referenced content

Try it: Click one of your block reference links and watch it navigate to the exact paragraph.

> **Note:**
**Success:** You've created your first block references! These links are now connected at the block level, enabling precise knowledge connections.


---

### Step 4: Embedding Block Content

Block references aren't just links - you can embed the actual content.

#### 4.1 Embed Syntax

Use an exclamation mark before the block reference: `![[Note^block-id]]`

#### 4.2 Create an Embedded Note

Create a note called `Daily Review - 2024-01-15`

```markdown
# Daily Review - January 15, 2024

## What I Learned Today

### Key Insight on Habits

![[Book - Atomic Habits^compound-effect]]

This resonates with my experience learning programming. Small daily practice sessions (30 min) were more effective than weekend marathons (8 hours).

**My action:** Apply the 1% rule to:
- Reading (10 pages daily)
- Writing (200 words daily)
- Exercise (10 minutes daily)

### Habit Design Framework

I'm designing my morning routine using these principles:

![[Book - Atomic Habits^law-1]]
![[Book - Atomic Habits^law-2]]
![[Book - Atomic Habits^law-3]]
![[Book - Atomic Habits^law-4]]

### Environment Changes

![[Book - Atomic Habits^environment-power]]

**Actions I'm taking:**
- Placing running shoes by bed → Make exercise obvious
- Deleting social media apps → Make distraction difficult
- Keeping book on nightstand → Make reading easy
```

#### 4.3 How Embeds Work

When you embed a block:
- The content appears inline in your note
- It stays synced with the original (read-only)
- Changes to the source update everywhere
- A link to the source note is preserved

> **Note:**
**Info:** Embedded blocks are read-only. To edit, click the link to open the source note.

### Step 5: Real-World Application

Let's apply block references to a practical scenario: academic research notes.

#### 5.1 The Scenario

You're writing a research paper on productivity systems. You've read multiple books and need to connect specific ideas across your notes.

#### 5.2 Create Literature Notes

Create `Book - Deep Work`:

```markdown
# Deep Work by Cal Newport

## Core Concepts

Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks. ^deep-work-definition

Deep work is rare, valuable, and meaningful. ^deep-work-value

Shallow work: non-cognitively demanding, logistical tasks. ^shallow-work-definition

The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare while simultaneously becoming increasingly valuable. ^deep-work-paradox

## Strategies

Schedule every minute of your day. ^time-blocking

Work in 90-minute focused blocks with breaks between. ^ultradian-rhythm

Shut down completely at end of work day. ^shutdown-ritual
```

Create `Book - The Power of Habit`:

```markdown
# The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg

## The Habit Loop

Every habit consists of a cue, routine, and reward. ^habit-loop

To change a habit, keep the cue and reward the same but change the routine. ^habit-change-strategy

Keystone habits are small changes that cascade to other positive behaviors. ^keystone-habits

## Willpower

Willpower is a muscle that gets tired with use. ^willpower-muscle

To conserve willpower, make important decisions and do hard tasks early in the day. ^willpower-conservation
```

#### 5.3 Create a Synthesis Note

Create `Research Paper - Productivity Framework`:

```markdown
# Research Paper: Productivity Framework

## Thesis

Sustainable productivity requires combining deep work practices with habit systems that conserve cognitive resources.

## Section 1: Defining Deep Work

![[Book - Deep Work^deep-work-definition]]

![[Book - Deep Work^deep-work-value]]

This matters because: [[Book - Deep Work^deep-work-paradox]]

## Section 2: The Habit Foundation

Productivity shouldn't rely on willpower. As Duhigg explains: [[Book - The Power of Habit^willpower-muscle]]

Strategy: [[Book - The Power of Habit^willpower-conservation]]

By turning deep work into a habit, we preserve willpower for creative thinking.

## Section 3: Implementation Framework

### Building Deep Work Habits

Combine Newport's time structure:
- [[Book - Deep Work^time-blocking]]
- [[Book - Deep Work^ultradian-rhythm]]
- [[Book - Deep Work^shutdown-ritual]]

With Duhigg's habit mechanics:
- [[Book - The Power of Habit^habit-loop]]
- [[Book - The Power of Habit^keystone-habits]]

### Practical Application

![[Book - Atomic Habits^law-1]]
![[Book - Atomic Habits^law-2]]
![[Book - Atomic Habits^law-3]]
![[Book - Atomic Habits^law-4]]

## Section 4: Environment Design

![[Book - Atomic Habits^environment-power]]

**My deep work environment:**
- Dedicated desk (cue for deep work)
- Phone in different room (remove shallow work triggers)
- 90-minute timer visible (make time blocking obvious)
- Coffee prepared beforehand (make deep work easy)

## Conclusion

By synthesizing insights from multiple sources at the block level, we create a cohesive framework that's greater than the sum of its parts.
```

> **Note:**
**Success:** You've created a research synthesis using block references! Notice how you've connected specific ideas from three different books without copying text or losing context.

### Step 6: Block References Best Practices

Now that you've mastered the basics, let's cover best practices.

#### 6.1 When to Use Block References

**Good Use Cases:**
- Specific quotes you'll reference multiple times
- Key definitions or concepts
- Evidence for arguments
- Data points or statistics
- Actionable insights
- Specific examples

**When NOT to Use:**
- Linking entire sections (use regular wiki links)
- Every sentence (too granular)
- Temporary notes (block IDs add overhead)
- Quick capture (add IDs during review)

#### 6.2 Block ID Naming

**Descriptive IDs (Recommended):**
```markdown
Getting 1% better each day = 37x in a year. ^compound-effect-math
```
- Easy to remember
- Self-documenting
- Searchable

**Auto-Generated IDs:**
```markdown
Getting 1% better each day = 37x in a year. ^a3x9k2m4
```
- Quick to create
- Guaranteed unique
- No naming overhead

> **Note:**
**Pro Tip:** Use descriptive IDs for blocks you'll reference often. Use auto-generated IDs for quick capture during reading.


#### 6.3 Organization Strategy

**Progressive Capture:**

1. **First pass (Reading):** Take notes without block IDs
2. **Second pass (Review):** Add block IDs to key insights
3. **Third pass (Synthesis):** Create references in synthesis notes

**Tag Referenceable Blocks:**

```markdown
Important definition here. ^key-definition #definition

This is a core principle. ^core-principle #principle

Specific data point: 73% of users. ^user-stat #data
```

---

### Step 7: Advanced Techniques

Take your block references to the next level.

#### 7.1 Block Reference Chains

Create sequences of related blocks:

```markdown
# Learning Pathway - Productivity

## Foundation
Start here: ![[Book - Atomic Habits^compound-effect]]

## Building Blocks
Then understand: ![[Book - The Power of Habit^habit-loop]]

## Deep Work
Finally master: ![[Book - Deep Work^deep-work-definition]]

## Integration
Combine all three: [[Research Paper - Productivity Framework^thesis]]
```

#### 7.2 Block Collections

Group related blocks by theme:

```markdown
# Quotes - On Focus

![[Book - Deep Work^deep-work-definition]]

![[Book - Deep Work^shallow-work-definition]]

![[Book - Atomic Habits^environment-power]]

![[Book - The Power of Habit^willpower-muscle]]
```

#### 7.3 Argument Building

Use blocks as evidence:

```markdown
# Argument: Why Deep Work Matters

**Claim:** Deep work is the most valuable skill in the modern economy.

**Evidence:**
1. [[Book - Deep Work^deep-work-value]]
2. [[Book - Deep Work^deep-work-paradox]]

**Supporting mechanics:**
- [[Book - The Power of Habit^willpower-muscle]]
- [[Book - Atomic Habits^compound-effect]]

**Conclusion:** By combining deep work habits with environment design, we maximize valuable output while minimizing willpower depletion.
```

### Step 8: Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions.

#### Problem: Block Link Not Working

**Symptom:** Click block reference, nothing happens

**Solutions:**
- Verify block ID exists in target note
- Check spelling (block IDs are case-sensitive)
- Ensure no extra spaces: `[[Note^blockid]]` not `[[Note ^blockid]]`
- Re-save the target note to refresh index

#### Problem: Block ID Not Showing

**Symptom:** Added `^blockid` but it's not recognized

**Solutions:**
- Add space before `^`: `text ^blockid`
- Check block type (only works on paragraphs, headings, lists, quotes)
- Ensure block ID format: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`
- Don't use special characters

#### Problem: Embed Shows Old Content

**Symptom:** Embedded block hasn't updated

**Solutions:**
- Refresh the note (Cmd/Ctrl + R)
- Re-open the note
- Check if source was actually saved

#### Problem: Too Many Block IDs

**Symptom:** Note cluttered with `^blockid` markers

**Solutions:**
- Only add IDs to blocks you'll actually reference
- Review and remove unused block IDs
- Use auto-generated IDs to reduce visual clutter
- Consider if regular wiki links would suffice

- See who changed what and when
- Revert to previous versions if needed
- Understand knowledge evolution over time

**Distributed Collaboration:**
- Each team member has full local copy
- Work offline, sync when connected
- No single point of failure
- Fast local operations

**Branching:**
- Experiment without affecting main workspace
- Review changes before merging
- Parallel workstreams for different projects
- Feature branches for major additions

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Automatic merging when possible
- Clear conflict indicators when manual resolution needed
- No lost work - all changes preserved
- Tools to choose best version

## Step 1: Setting Up Your First Shared Workspace

Let's create a GitHub-backed workspace for your team.

### 1.1 Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub** (github.com)
2. **Click "New Repository"**
3. **Configure:**
   - **Repository name:** `team-knowledge-base`
   - **Description:** "Shared team knowledge in Lokus"
   - **Visibility:**
     - Private (recommended for team work)
     - Public (if sharing openly)
   - **Initialize:**
     - ✓ Add README
     - ✓ Add .gitignore (choose "Node" template)
     - License (optional, choose MIT for openness)
4. **Click "Create Repository"**

### 1.2 Generate GitHub Personal Access Token

Lokus uses tokens instead of passwords for secure authentication.

**Steps:**

1. **GitHub Settings** → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. **Click "Generate new token (classic)"**
3. **Configure token:**
   - **Note:** "Lokus Team Workspace"
   - **Expiration:** 90 days (or longer for convenience)
   - **Scopes:**
     - ✓ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - ✓ `workflow` (if using GitHub Actions)
4. **Generate token**
5. **Copy token immediately** (won't be shown again!)
   - Format: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

> **Note:**
> **Warning:** Treat your token like a password! Store it securely. Anyone with your token can access your repositories.


### 1.3 Configure Lokus Git Sync

1. **Open Lokus Settings** (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. **Navigate to "Sync" section**
3. **Expand "Git Configuration"**
4. **Configure:**

```yaml
Remote URL: https://github.com/yourusername/team-knowledge-base.git
Username: yourusername
Token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Branch: main
Author Name: Your Name
Author Email: you@example.com
```

5. **Initialize Git** (if new workspace)
   - Click "Initialize Git Repository"
   - Waits for confirmation

6. **Connect Remote**
   - Click "Add Remote"
   - Connects to GitHub

7. **Initial Sync**
   - Click "Pull Changes" to fetch README
   - Confirms connection working

**Visual Confirmation:**
- Status bar shows sync icon ✓
- "Synced" status indicator
- No errors in console

### 1.4 Share Repository with Team

**Invite Collaborators:**

1. **GitHub Repository** → Settings → Collaborators
2. **Click "Add people"**
3. **Enter teammate usernames or emails**
4. **Select role:**
   - **Write** - Can push changes (most team members)
   - **Admin** - Can manage repo settings
5. **Send invitations**

**Team members accept and clone:**

1. **Accept GitHub invitation email**
2. **Open Lokus** → Settings → Sync
3. **Configure same remote URL and credentials**
4. **Pull changes** to get current workspace
5. **Start collaborating!**

## Step 2: Daily Collaboration Workflow

Learn the basic sync workflow for daily team collaboration.

### 2.1 Starting Your Day

**Morning Sync Routine:**

1. **Pull latest changes** before starting work
   - Status bar → Click sync icon
   - Or right-click → "Pull Changes"
   - Reviews what teammates added overnight

2. **Check sync status**
   - Green checkmark = All synced
   - Yellow indicator = Changes to push
   - Orange triangle = Conflicts need attention
   - Red X = Sync error

3. **Review recent changes**
   - Command Palette → "Show Recent Changes"
   - See what teammates modified
   - Read new notes they added

**Example Morning Review:**

```
Recent Changes (last 24 hours):

Alice - 2 hours ago
  + Added "Product Roadmap Q1 2026.md"
  + Updated "Team Goals.md"

Bob - 5 hours ago
  ~ Modified "Meeting Notes 2025-11-11.md"

Carol - 8 hours ago
  + Added "Customer Interview - Acme Corp.md"
  ~ Modified "Feature Requests.md"
```

### 2.2 Making Changes

**Collaborative Editing:**

**Add New Notes:**
```markdown
# New Feature Proposal
Author: @yourname
Date: 2025-11-12

## Problem
[Describe issue...]

## Proposed Solution
[Your solution...]

## Discussion
- @alice: [Alice's input]
- @bob: [Bob's input]
```

**Update Existing Notes:**
```markdown
# Team Goals

## Q1 2026
- [ ] Launch new feature (@alice, @bob)
- [ ] Improve onboarding (@carol)
- [x] Update documentation (@yourname) - DONE 2025-11-12
```

**Best Practices:**
- ✓ Sign contributions with @username
- ✓ Add dates to updates
- ✓ Use task assignments
- ✓ Comment reasoning for changes
- ✗ Don't delete others' work without discussion
- ✗ Don't make massive changes without branches

### 2.3 Committing and Pushing

**Manual Commit:**

1. **Make changes** to notes
2. **Review changes** (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + G shows git status)
3. **Status bar shows** "Changes pending"
4. **Click sync icon** or use menu:
   - Right-click sync → "Commit & Push"
5. **Auto-commit message:** "Auto-sync workspace - 2025-11-12 14:30"
6. **Push to GitHub**
7. **Status updates** to "Synced" ✓

**Automatic Sync:**

Settings → Sync → Auto-sync:
```yaml
Enable Auto-sync: ON
Sync interval: 30 seconds
Auto-commit: ON
Auto-push: ON
Commit message: "Auto-sync workspace"
```

With auto-sync:
- Saves trigger auto-commit
- Commits push automatically
- Background sync every 30 seconds
- Zero manual intervention

**When to Manual vs Auto:**

**Auto-sync best for:**
- Small teams (2-5 people)
- Frequent small changes
- High trust environment
- Real-time collaboration

**Manual sync best for:**
- Larger teams (5+ people)
- Major structural changes
- Reviewed workflows
- Branches and PRs

### 2.4 Pulling Teammates' Changes

**When to Pull:**

- **Start of day** - Get overnight changes
- **Before major edits** - Avoid conflicts
- **After teammate mentions sync** - Get their updates
- **Sync indicator shows behind** - Fetch remote changes

**Pull Process:**

1. **Click sync icon** → "Pull Changes"
2. **Or right-click** → "Pull Changes"
3. **Lokus fetches** remote commits
4. **Auto-merges** if no conflicts
5. **Shows summary:**
   ```
   Pulled 3 commits from origin/main
   + 2 files added
   ~ 1 file modified
   - 0 files deleted

   Already up to date!
   ```

**If Fast-Forward:**
- Your changes preserved
- Teammate changes added
- No conflicts

**If Merge Required:**
- Lokus creates merge commit
- Auto-merges compatible changes
- Flags conflicts for review

---

## Step 3: Handling Merge Conflicts

Learn to resolve conflicts when team members edit the same content.

### 3.1 Understanding Conflicts

**When Do Conflicts Occur?**

**Scenario:** Alice and Bob both edit "Team Goals.md"

**Alice's Version (local):**
```markdown
# Team Goals

## Q1 2026
- [ ] Launch Feature X
- [ ] Improve Documentation
```

**Bob's Version (remote, pushed first):**
```markdown
# Team Goals

## Q1 2026
- [ ] Launch Feature X
- [ ] Update Onboarding
```

Both edited line 5. Git can't auto-merge.

### 3.2 Detecting Conflicts

**Visual Indicators:**

1. **Status bar** shows orange triangle ⚠
2. **Status text** says "X conflicts"
3. **Notification** appears: "Merge conflicts detected"
4. **Sync menu** highlights conflicted files

**Open Sync Menu:**
- Click sync icon → Shows conflict details
- Lists conflicted files:
  ```
  ⚠️ 2 Conflicts Detected

  Conflicting files:
  - Team Goals.md
  - Project Timeline.md
  ```

### 3.3 Resolving Conflicts Manually

**Open Conflicted File:**

`Team Goals.md` now contains conflict markers:

```markdown
# Team Goals

## Q1 2026
- [ ] Launch Feature X
<<<<<<< Your Changes
- [ ] Improve Documentation
=======
- [ ] Update Onboarding
>>>>>>> Remote
```

**Conflict Markers Explained:**

```
<<<<<<< Your Changes     ← Start of your version
- [ ] Improve Documentation  ← Your content
=======                 ← Divider
- [ ] Update Onboarding     ← Remote content
>>>>>>> Remote          ← End of remote version
```

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Review both versions** - Understand changes
2. **Decide which to keep:**
   - Keep yours only
   - Keep remote only
   - Keep both (merge manually)
   - Rewrite combining both
3. **Edit the file:**

**Option A: Keep Both**
```markdown
# Team Goals

## Q1 2026
- [ ] Launch Feature X
- [ ] Improve Documentation
- [ ] Update Onboarding
```

**Option B: Keep Yours**
```markdown
# Team Goals

## Q1 2026
- [ ] Launch Feature X
- [ ] Improve Documentation
```

**Option C: Keep Remote**
```markdown
# Team Goals

## Q1 2026
- [ ] Launch Feature X
- [ ] Update Onboarding
```

4. **Remove ALL conflict markers** (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
5. **Save file**
6. **Commit & Push:**
   - Sync icon → "Commit & Push"
   - Message: "Resolved conflict in Team Goals"
   - Pushes resolution

### 3.4 Using Force Push/Pull (Last Resort)

**⚠️ WARNING: These commands overwrite changes. Use with caution!**

**Force Push (Your Version Wins):**

Use when:
- You're certain your version is correct
- Remote has broken/corrupted changes
- Team agreed to discard remote

```
Sync menu → Advanced → Force Push
Confirm: "Overwrite remote with my local changes"
```

**Result:**
- Remote repository now matches your local
- All remote changes since last sync are lost
- Teammates must force pull to get your version

**Force Pull (Remote Version Wins):**

Use when:
- Remote is correct, your local is wrong
- You want to discard all local changes
- Starting fresh from remote

```
Sync menu → Advanced → Force Pull
Confirm: "Discard all local changes"
```

**Result:**
- Local workspace now matches remote
- All your local changes since last sync are lost
- Your workspace is clean copy of remote

**Best Practices:**

✓ **Coordinate with team** before force operations
✓ **Backup locally** before force pull
✓ **Use sparingly** - Last resort only
✗ **Never force push to main** without team consensus
✗ **Don't force operations during active work**

## Step 4: Branch Workflows for Teams

Use branches for organized collaboration.

### 4.1 Why Use Branches?

**Benefits:**

**Isolation:**
- Experiment without affecting main workspace
- Test ideas safely
- Multiple parallel workstreams

**Review:**
- Changes reviewed before merging to main
- Team approval workflow
- Quality control

**Organization:**
- Feature branches for specific work
- Topic branches for discussions
- Personal branches for exploration

### 4.2 Creating and Using Branches

**Create Feature Branch:**

1. **Current branch:** `main`
2. **Command Palette** → "Create Branch"
3. **Branch name:** `feature/customer-success-docs`
4. **Lokus creates** and switches to new branch
5. **Status bar** shows: `feature/customer-success-docs`

**Make Changes on Branch:**

```markdown
# Customer Success Documentation

## Onboarding Process
[Write new content...]

## Common Issues
[Document solutions...]
```

**Commit to Branch:**
- Changes only affect feature branch
- Main branch unchanged
- Push to remote branch

**Switch Between Branches:**

```
Command Palette → "Switch Branch"
Select: main
Status bar updates: main
```

Notes change to main branch version!

### 4.3 Branch Workflow Patterns

**Pattern 1: Feature Branches**

**Use case:** Adding major new content

```
main
  ↓
feature/product-docs (Alice works here)
  ↓
Review → Merge to main
```

**Process:**
1. Alice creates `feature/product-docs`
2. Alice writes documentation
3. Alice pushes branch to GitHub
4. Team reviews on GitHub
5. Alice merges to main via GitHub PR
6. Alice deletes feature branch

**Pattern 2: Personal Branches**

**Use case:** Individual work areas

```
main
  ├─ alice/research (Alice's notes)
  ├─ bob/experiments (Bob's ideas)
  └─ carol/projects (Carol's projects)
```

**Process:**
- Each person has permanent personal branch
- Periodically merge relevant content to main
- Main stays clean, personal branches are playgrounds

**Pattern 3: Topic Branches**

**Use case:** Collaborative editing of specific topics

```
main
  ↓
topic/q1-planning (Team collaborates)
  ↓
All discuss → Merge when finalized
```

**Process:**
1. Create topic branch for discussion
2. Multiple team members push to same branch
3. Discuss and iterate
4. Merge to main when consensus reached

### 4.4 Merging Branches

**GitHub Pull Request (Recommended):**

1. **Push branch** to GitHub
2. **Create PR** on GitHub
   - base: `main`
   - compare: `feature/your-branch`
3. **Add reviewers** (team members)
4. **Reviewers comment** and approve
5. **Merge PR** on GitHub
6. **Pull main** in Lokus to get merged changes
7. **Delete branch** (optional)

**Direct Merge in Lokus:**

1. **Switch to main:** `Switch Branch → main`
2. **Command Palette** → "Merge Branch"
3. **Select branch:** `feature/customer-docs`
4. **Preview changes** in merge dialog
5. **Confirm merge**
6. **Resolve conflicts** if any
7. **Push to remote**

## Step 5: Team Collaboration Best Practices

Ensure smooth collaboration with these practices.

### 5.1 Communication Protocols

**Before Editing Shared Notes:**

```markdown
# Team Goals

**EDITING: @alice (2025-11-12 14:30)**
Working on Q1 goals section...

## Q1 2026
[Alice's work in progress...]
```

**After Editing:**
```markdown
# Team Goals

**LAST UPDATED: @alice (2025-11-12 15:00)**

## Q1 2026
[Completed content...]
```

**Use Note Metadata:**

```yaml
---
owner: alice
last_editor: alice
edit_date: 2025-11-12
status: draft
review_needed: true
reviewers: [bob, carol]
---
```

**Team Agreement Template:**

`Team/Collaboration Guidelines.md`:
```markdown
# Collaboration Guidelines

## Sync Frequency
- Pull at start of each work session
- Push after completing a task
- Check status indicator before major edits

## Conflict Resolution
- Prefer merging over overwriting
- Discuss conflicts in Slack/Teams before force operations
- Tag relevant person if unsure: @owner

## Branch Usage
- Feature branches for major additions
- Topic branches for collaborative discussions
- Merge to main after team review

## Note Ownership
- Add owner to frontmatter
- Tag edits with @username
- Request review before major changes to others' notes

## Communication
- Announce major workspace changes in team chat
- Use comments in notes for discussions
- Weekly sync meeting to review workspace health

## File Organization
- Follow agreed folder structure (see [[Workspace Structure]])
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Don't move others' files without asking

## Emergency Contacts
- Workspace admin: @alice
- Sync issues: @bob
- Conflict resolution: @carol
```

### 5.2 Workspace Organization for Teams

**Folder Structure:**

```
Team Workspace/
├── Shared/                  # Team-wide resources
│   ├── Goals.md
│   ├── Processes.md
│   └── Guidelines.md
├── Projects/               # Active projects
│   ├── Project-Alpha/
│   │   ├── Overview.md (@alice)
│   │   ├── Tasks.md (shared)
│   │   └── Notes.md (shared)
│   └── Project-Beta/
├── People/                 # Personal folders
│   ├── Alice/
│   ├── Bob/
│   └── Carol/
├── Meetings/              # Meeting notes

└── Templates/             # Shared templates
    ├── Meeting-Notes.md
    ├── Project-Brief.md
    └── Decision-Log.md
```

**Guidelines:**

- **Shared/** - Team-edited, high sync traffic
- **People/** - Personal, low conflicts
- **Projects/** - Designated owners, medium sync
- **Meetings/** - Sequential, time-based, low conflicts
- **Archive/** - Read-only, no edits after archiving

### 5.3 Preventing Conflicts

**Strategy 1: Designated Editors**

```yaml
# Project Alpha Overview.md
---
primary_editor: alice
contributors: [bob, carol]
edit_protocol: "Contact @alice before major changes"
---
```

**Strategy 2: Time-Based Editing**

```markdown
# Shared Document Schedule

Monday: @alice can edit 9am-12pm
Tuesday: @bob can edit 9am-12pm
Wednesday: @carol can edit 9am-12pm
Thursday: Open editing (sync frequently)
Friday: Review only (no edits)
```

**Strategy 3: Section Ownership**

```markdown
# Team Handbook

## Engineering (Owner: @alice)
[Alice's section - others add comments only]

## Design (Owner: @bob)
[Bob's section]

## Product (Owner: @carol)
[Carol's section]

## Discussion (Shared)
[Anyone can edit]
```

**Strategy 4: Locking Notes**

```yaml
---
locked: true
locked_by: alice
locked_until: 2025-11-12 15:00
reason: "Major restructure in progress"
---
```

### 5.4 Monitoring Workspace Health

**Daily Checks:**

Command Palette → "Workspace Health"

Shows:
```
Workspace Health Report
=======================

Sync Status: ✓ Healthy
Last Sync: 2 minutes ago
Pending Changes: 0
Conflicts: 0

Recent Activity:
- 15 commits today
- 3 active editors
- 8 files modified

Warnings:
- None

Recommendations:
- All clear! Keep it up.
```

**Weekly Maintenance:**

1. **Archive completed work**
   ```
   Projects/Completed/ → Archive/2025-11/
   ```

2. **Clean up stale branches**
   ```
   git branch -d old-feature-branch
   ```

3. **Review large files**
   ```
   Settings → Storage → Show Large Files
   Consider external storage for 10MB+ files
   ```

4. **Audit permissions**
   ```
   GitHub → Settings → Collaborators
   Remove former team members
   ```

---

## Step 6: Troubleshooting Common Issues

Solve frequent collaboration problems.

### 6.1 Authentication Failures

**Symptom:** "Authentication failed" when pushing/pulling

**Solutions:**

1. **Token expired**
   - Generate new GitHub token
   - Update in Settings → Sync → Token

2. **Wrong token**
   - Verify token has `repo` scope
   - Ensure copying full token (starts with `ghp_`)

3. **Username mismatch**
   - Username must match GitHub username exactly
   - Case-sensitive

**Test authentication:**
```
Settings → Sync → Test Connection
```

### 6.2 Persistent Conflicts

**Symptom:** Same file shows conflicts repeatedly

**Solutions:**

1. **Coordinate with team member**
   - Chat: "Hey @alice, let's resolve Team Goals.md conflict together"
   - Screen share to resolve together

2. **One person force push**
   - Agree on whose version to keep
   - That person force pushes
   - Other person force pulls

3. **Create new file**
   - Rename conflicted file: `Team Goals - OLD.md`
   - Create new clean: `Team Goals.md`
   - Merge content manually

### 6.3 Large File Issues

**Symptom:** Slow pushes/pulls, repository bloated

**Solutions:**

1. **Identify large files**
   ```
   Settings → Storage → Show Large Files
   ```

2. **Move to external storage**
   - Use cloud storage (Dropbox, Drive) for videos/images
   - Link in notes instead of committing

3. **Use Git LFS** (Large File Storage)
   - For files > 10MB that must be versioned
   - Requires repository configuration

4. **Clean up history** (advanced)
   - Use BFG Repo-Cleaner to purge large files
   - Coordinate with entire team

### 6.4 Diverged Branches

**Symptom:** "Your branch has diverged from origin/main"

**Cause:** Local and remote have incompatible histories

**Solution:**

**Option 1: Merge** (preserves all changes)
```
Pull with merge commit
Resolve conflicts
Push merged result
```

**Option 2: Rebase** (clean linear history)
```
Git rebase origin/main
Resolve conflicts as they appear
Force push (if safe)
```

**Option 3: Reset** (discard local, use remote)
```
Force Pull
Local changes lost, remote becomes local
```

---

## Practice Exercise

**Goal:** Set up real team collaboration

**Task:** Work with a teammate to:

1. **One person:**
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Configure Lokus sync
   - Create initial structure
   - Invite teammate

2. **Other person:**
   - Accept invitation
   - Clone via Lokus sync
   - Add a note
   - Push changes

3. **Both simultaneously:**
   - Edit the same note differently
   - Try to push
   - Resolve conflict together

4. **First person:**
   - Create feature branch
   - Add content on branch
   - Push branch
   - Create GitHub PR

5. **Second person:**
   - Review PR on GitHub
   - Approve and merge
   - Pull merged changes in Lokus

**Bonus:** Set up auto-sync and test it with rapid back-and-forth edits.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Not Seeing Teammate's Changes

**Solution:**
- Click sync icon → Pull Changes
- Verify teammate pushed (ask them)
- Check branch (same branch?)
- Confirm remote URL matches

### Push Rejected

**Solution:**
- Pull first to merge remote changes
- Resolve any conflicts
- Then push
- Never force push without team OK

### Missing Sync Icon

**Solution:**
- Settings → Sync → Enable Git Sync
- Verify Git initialized
- Check remote configured
- Restart Lokus

### Slow Syncs

**Solution:**
- Repository too large (move big files out)
- Many files changed (batch edits, sync less often)
- Network slow (check connection)
- Background processes (close other apps)

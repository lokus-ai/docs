## Example Workflow

Let's walk through a complete research workflow.

### Week 1: Literature Review

**Monday - Reading Papers**

1. Read paper on learning theory
2. Create literature note using template
3. Extract 3 key findings with block IDs
4. Add important quotes with block IDs
5. Create concept map in Mermaid

**Literature Note Example:**

```markdown
# Self-Regulated Learning: A Review

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Metacognitive Strategies

Students who use metacognitive strategies show 20% better performance.

**Evidence:** Multiple studies (Zimmerman, 2002; Schunk & Zimmerman, 2008) demonstrate the correlation between metacognitive awareness and academic achievement. ^metacog-evidence

**Related:** [[Metacognition]], [[Self-Regulation]]

---

### Finding 2: Goal Setting

Specific, challenging goals lead to higher performance than easy or "do your best" goals.

**Key mechanism:** Goals direct attention and mobilize effort. ^goal-setting-mechanism

**Related:** [[Goal-Setting Theory]], [[Motivation]]
```

**Tuesday - Create Permanent Notes**

Extract concepts from literature note:

```markdown
# Metacognitive Strategies

Clear, self-contained definition of metacognitive strategies.

## Evidence

![[Self-Regulated Learning^metacog-evidence]]

![[Another Paper^supporting-finding]]

## Related Concepts

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Metacognition] --> B[Planning]
    A --> C[Monitoring]
    A --> D[Evaluating]
    B --> E[Goal Setting]
    C --> F[Self-Assessment]
    D --> G[Reflection]
```
```

**Wednesday - Build Connections**

Create structure note organizing the topic:

```markdown
# Structure Note: Learning Theory

## Core Concepts

- [[Self-Regulation]] - ability to control one's learning
- [[Metacognition]] - thinking about thinking
- [[Motivation]] - drive to learn

## Relationships

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Effective Learning] --> B[Self-Regulation]
    B --> C[Metacognition]
    B --> D[Motivation]
    B --> E[Goal-Setting]
    C --> F[Planning]
    C --> G[Monitoring]
    C --> H[Evaluation]
    D --> I[Intrinsic]
    D --> J[Extrinsic]
```

## Key Studies

- [[Zimmerman 2002]] - foundational work
- [[Schunk & Zimmerman 2008]] - empirical evidence
- [[Winne & Hadwin 1998]] - model development
```

### Week 2-3: Writing

**Create Outline:**

```markdown
# Dissertation Chapter 2 - Literature Review

## 2.1 Theoretical Framework

### 2.1.1 Self-Regulated Learning

![[Self-Regulation^definition]]

Historical development:
- [[Zimmerman 1989]] introduced the concept
- [[Pintrich 2000]] expanded the model

### 2.1.2 Metacognitive Strategies

![[Metacognitive Strategies^definition]]

Evidence:
- ![[Self-Regulated Learning Review^metacog-evidence]]
- ![[Study 2^finding-1]]

## 2.2 Empirical Evidence

### 2.2.1 Goal Setting Effects

![[Goal-Setting Theory^mechanism]]

Studies showing effectiveness:
- [[Locke & Latham 1990]] - [[#^finding-1]]
- [[Zimmerman et al 1992]] - [[#^finding-2]]
```

**Draft Chapter:**

Use block embeds to include evidence from literature notes directly in your writing. When you update the source note, the embedded content updates automatically.

---

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Concept Map Gallery

Create `Structure/Concept Map - Learning Theory`:

```markdown
# Learning Theory Concept Map

## Big Picture

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Learning] --> B[Cognitive Processes]
    A --> C[Social Factors]
    A --> D[Motivation]

    B --> E[Metacognition]
    B --> F[Memory]
    B --> G[Attention]

    C --> H[Peer Learning]
    C --> I[Cultural Context]

    D --> J[Intrinsic]
    D --> K[Extrinsic]

    E --> L[Planning]
    E --> M[Monitoring]
    E --> N[Evaluation]

    L --> O[Goal Setting]
    M --> P[Self-Assessment]
    N --> Q[Reflection]
```

## Detailed View: Self-Regulation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant L as Learner
    participant T as Task
    participant S as Strategy
    participant M as Monitor

    L->>T: Encounter learning task
    L->>S: Select strategy
    L->>M: Begin monitoring
    S->>T: Apply strategy
    M->>L: Provide feedback
    L->>S: Adjust strategy
    S->>T: Continue learning
    T-->>L: Learning outcome
    L->>L: Evaluate & reflect
```
```

### 2. Literature Matrix

Track multiple sources on same topic:

```markdown
# Literature Matrix - Self-Regulated Learning

| Author | Year | Method | Sample | Key Finding | Supports/Contradicts |
|--------|------|--------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| [[Zimmerman]] | 2002 | Review | Meta-analysis | [[#^finding]] | Foundational |
| [[Pintrich]] | 2000 | Theory | Conceptual | [[#^model]] | Extends Zimmerman |
| [[Winne]] | 1998 | Model | Framework | [[#^process]] | Alternative view |
| [[Schunk]] | 2008 | Empirical | 250 students | [[#^evidence]] | Supports Zimmerman |
```

### 3. Research Questions Evolution

Track how your research questions develop:

```markdown
# Research Questions - Evolution

## January 2024

**Initial Question:**
How do metacognitive strategies affect learning?

**Too broad - refined to:**

## February 2024

**Refined Question:**
What specific metacognitive strategies improve self-regulated learning in online environments?

**After literature review:**
- [[Study 1]] showed context matters
- [[Study 2]] highlighted strategy types

**Further refined to:**

## March 2024

**Final Question:**
How do planning and monitoring strategies affect self-regulated learning outcomes in asynchronous online courses among undergraduate students?

**Sub-questions:**
1. Which planning strategies are most effective?
2. How do monitoring behaviors correlate with outcomes?
3. What moderating factors influence strategy effectiveness?
```

## Tips for Success

### 1. Daily Routine

**Morning (15 min):**
- Review yesterday's research log
- Set today's priorities
- Check advisor emails

**Throughout Day:**
- Capture fleeting notes in Inbox
- Use daily research log
- Add block IDs to key passages

**Evening (30 min):**
- Process inbox notes
- Create/update permanent notes
- Update daily research log
- Plan tomorrow

### 2. Weekly Review

Every Sunday:
- Review week's reading (15 papers target)
- Process all inbox notes
- Update structure notes
- Track writing progress
- Plan next week

### 3. Monthly Check-in

- Review research questions
- Update literature matrix
- Check progress toward milestones
- Meet with advisor
- Adjust workflow as needed

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I have too many fleeting notes"

- Set aside 30 min daily to process
- Delete ruthlessly - not everything is important
- If a note is >3 days old and not processed, probably delete it

### "My permanent notes feel disconnected"

- Create more structure notes
- Use block references to connect evidence
- Build concept maps regularly
- Review backlinks panel

### "Writing is slow"

- Use block embeds from permanent notes
- Create detailed outlines first
- Write daily, even just 200 words
- Don't aim for perfect first drafts

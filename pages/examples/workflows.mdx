### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Create Daily Note (Auto-Generated)

```yaml
# automation/create-daily-note.yaml
trigger:
  type: scheduled
  time: "06:00"
  days: [Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun]

actions:
  - create_note:
      template: daily-note-template
      folder: 05-daily/{{date:YYYY}}/{{date:MM-MMMM}}
      filename: "{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}.md"

  - open_note:
      path: "{{daily_note.path}}"

  - notify:
      title: "Good morning!"
      message: "Your daily note is ready"
```

#### Step 2: Review Yesterday (Manual)

Open yesterday's note and:
1. Complete evening reflection if not done
2. Move incomplete tasks to today
3. Note any follow-ups

```javascript
// Plugin: Review Yesterday
async function reviewYesterday() {
  const yesterday = moment().subtract(1, 'day').format('YYYY-MM-DD');
  const yesterdayNote = await lokud.notes.get(`05-daily/${yesterday}.md`);

  if (!yesterdayNote) return;

  // Extract incomplete tasks
  const incompleteTasks = yesterdayNote.content
    .match(/- \[ \] .+/g) || [];

  // Add to today's note
  if (incompleteTasks.length > 0) {
    const today = await lokud.notes.getDaily();
    await today.append('\n## Carried Over from Yesterday\n');
    await today.append(incompleteTasks.join('\n'));
  }

  // Show summary
  lokud.ui.notify({
    title: 'Yesterday Review',
    message: `${incompleteTasks.length} tasks carried over`
  });
}
```

#### Step 3: Review Tasks Database (Auto-Generated)

```yaml
# automation/morning-task-review.yaml
trigger:
  type: note_opened
  conditions:
    - type: daily-note

actions:
  # Query overdue tasks
  - query_database:
      base: Tasks
      filters:
        - field: Due Date
          operator: before
          value: "{{date:today}}"
        - field: Status
          operator: not_equals
          value: Done
      insert_at: "## Overdue Tasks"
      format: task_list

  # Query today's tasks
  - query_database:
      base: Tasks
      filters:
        - field: Status
          operator: equals
          value: Today
        - field: Status
          operator: not_equals
          value: Done
      sort:
        - field: Priority
          direction: asc
      insert_at: "## Tasks for Today"
      format: task_list
      group_by: Priority

  # Query this week's tasks
  - query_database:
      base: Tasks
      filters:
        - field: Due Date
          operator: between
          value: ["{{date:today}}", "{{date:week_end}}"]
        - field: Status
          operator: not_equals
          value: Done
      insert_at: "## Tasks This Week"
      format: compact_list
```

#### Step 4: Check Calendar (Auto-Generated)

```yaml
# automation/morning-calendar.yaml
trigger:
  type: note_opened
  conditions:
    - type: daily-note

actions:
  # Import calendar events
  - calendar_sync:
      date: "{{date:today}}"
      insert_at: "## Schedule"
      format: |
        - {{time}} - [[{{event.note_link}}|{{event.title}}]] {{#if event.location}}@ {{event.location}}{{/if}}

  # Create meeting notes for events
  - for_each_event:
      conditions:
        - type: meeting
        - attendees_count: ">1"
      actions:
        - create_note:
            template: meeting-notes-template
            folder: 10-meetings
            link_in_calendar: true
```

#### Step 5: Set Top 3 Priorities (Manual)

In the daily note, manually write your top 3 priorities:
1. Most important task (must finish today)
2. Second priority (should finish today)
3. Third priority (good to finish today)

**Tips for choosing priorities:**
- Align with weekly/monthly goals
- Consider energy levels
- Balance urgent vs. important
- Mix different types of work

#### Step 6: Time Block Schedule (Manual/Assisted)

```javascript
// Plugin: Suggest Time Blocks
async function suggestTimeBlocks() {
  const today = await lokud.notes.getDaily();
  const tasks = await lokud.databases.query('Tasks', {
    filters: { status: 'Today' }
  });

  // Group tasks by energy level
  const highEnergy = tasks.filter(t => t.energy === 'High Energy');
  const mediumEnergy = tasks.filter(t => t.energy === 'Medium Energy');
  const lowEnergy = tasks.filter(t => t.energy === 'Low Energy');

  // Suggest schedule based on typical energy curve
  const schedule = {
    '09:00 - 11:00': highEnergy[0], // Peak morning energy
    '11:00 - 12:00': mediumEnergy[0],
    '13:00 - 14:00': lowEnergy[0], // Post-lunch dip
    '14:00 - 16:00': highEnergy[1], // Afternoon peak
    '16:00 - 17:00': mediumEnergy[1],
  };

  return schedule;
}
```

# Smith et al. (2024) - Deep Learning for X

## Bibliographic Info
- **Authors**: Smith, A., Jones, B., Brown, C.
- **Year**: 2024
- **Journal**: Nature Machine Intelligence
- **DOI**: 10.1234/example
- **PDF**: [[pdfs/smith-2024.pdf]]

## One-Sentence Summary
Proposes a novel deep learning architecture that improves X by 25% through Y mechanism.

## Key Contributions
1. Novel architecture design
2. Theoretical analysis of why it works
3. Empirical validation on 5 datasets
4. Open-source implementation

## Methodology
- **Approach**: Supervised learning with novel architecture
- **Data**: 5 benchmark datasets (ImageNet, COCO, etc.)
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, F1, inference time
- **Baselines**: ResNet, VGG, Transformer

## Results
- 25% improvement over SOTA
- 3x faster inference
- Works across domains

## Strengths
- Rigorous experimental design
- Strong theoretical foundation
- Reproducible (code available)
- Clear writing

## Weaknesses
- Limited to supervised learning
- Expensive to train
- Doesn't address edge cases

## Relevance to My Research
This architecture could potentially be applied to my problem of Z. The theoretical framework might explain why my approach works.

# Attention Mechanism

## Core Idea
Attention allows a model to focus on relevant parts of the input when making predictions, rather than processing all inputs equally.

## Key Insight
Inspired by human visual attention - we focus on important parts of a scene rather than processing everything equally.

## Mathematical Formulation
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V

Where:
- Q: Query vectors (what we're looking for)
- K: Key vectors (what we have)
- V: Value vectors (what we return)
- d_k: Dimension of keys (for scaling)
```

## Intuition
1. Compare query against all keys (compute relevance)
2. Get attention weights (softmax of comparisons)
3. Weight values by attention scores
4. Sum weighted values

## Applications
- Machine translation [[paper-attention-translation|Bahdanau 2015]]
- Image captioning [[paper-show-attend-tell|Xu 2015]]
- General sequence modeling [[paper-transformer|Vaswani 2017]]

## Advantages
- Allows variable-length inputs
- Provides interpretability (can visualize attention)
- Captures long-range dependencies

## Disadvantages
- Quadratic complexity in sequence length
- Requires careful initialization
- Can be unstable during training

## Variants
- Self-attention [[concept-self-attention|Note]]
- Cross-attention [[concept-cross-attention|Note]]
- Multi-head attention [[concept-multi-head-attention|Note]]
- Sparse attention [[concept-sparse-attention|Note]]

## Personal Insights
Could attention be applied to my research problem? Instead of processing all features equally, selectively focus on relevant features based on context.

## Open Questions
- What is the minimum attention needed?
- Can we learn what to attend to?
- How does attention relate to biological attention?

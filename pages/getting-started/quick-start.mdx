# Quick Start

Get up and running with Lokus in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through the essential features to help you start taking notes effectively.

## First Launch

<Callout type="info">
**New in v1.3.4**: Lokus now features automatic updates, professional image viewing, and intelligent caching for 85-90% faster performance!
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Open Your First Workspace

When you first launch Lokus, you'll be prompted to open or create a workspace. A workspace is simply a folder on your computer where your notes will be stored.

1. Click **Open Workspace** or **Create New Workspace**
2. Select an empty folder or create a new one
3. Lokus will initialize the workspace and you're ready to start

> **Note:**
Your notes are stored as plain Markdown files on your local filesystem, giving you complete ownership and portability of your data.

<Callout>
**Automatic Updates**: Lokus will silently check for updates 3 seconds after launch. If an update is available, you'll be notified with an option to install it. [Learn more →](/features/auto-updater)
</Callout>


### Interface Overview

The Lokus interface consists of four main areas:

- **Sidebar** (Left): Navigate your folder structure, search notes, and access recent files
- **Editor** (Center): Write and edit your notes with a clean, distraction-free interface
- **Preview** (Right, optional): See a live preview of your rendered Markdown
- **Top Bar**: Quick actions, workspace selector, and settings

</Steps>

## Creating Your First Note

<Steps>

### Create a New Note

There are several ways to create a new note:

- Click the **New Note** button in the toolbar
- Use the keyboard shortcut: `Cmd+N` (Mac) or `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux)
- Right-click in the sidebar and select **New Note**

Give your note a meaningful name like `my-first-note.md`.

### Basic Markdown Formatting

Lokus supports standard Markdown syntax. Here are the essentials:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text** and *italic text*

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
  - Nested bullet

1. Numbered list
2. Second item

> This is a blockquote

`inline code` and code blocks:

\`\`\`javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, Lokus!");
}
\`\`\`
```

### Wiki Links

One of Lokus's most powerful features is wiki-style linking between notes:

```markdown
Link to another note: [[Note Title]]

Link with custom text: [[Note Title|Custom Display Text]]

Link to a heading: [[Note Title#Heading]]
```

When you type `[[`, Lokus will show an autocomplete dropdown with your existing notes. If you link to a note that doesn't exist yet, Lokus will create it when you click the link.

</Steps>

## Advanced Features

### Math Equations

Lokus supports LaTeX math equations using KaTeX:

**Inline math**: Wrap expressions in single dollar signs

```markdown
The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
```

**Block math**: Use double dollar signs for display equations

```markdown
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$
```

> **Note:** 
Math rendering happens in real-time as you type, making it perfect for technical notes and academic work.


### Task Lists

Create interactive checkboxes with task list syntax:

```markdown
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Another pending item
  - [ ] Nested subtask
```

Click any checkbox to toggle its completion state. Lokus saves the state automatically.

### Code Syntax Highlighting

Lokus provides syntax highlighting for numerous programming languages:

```markdown
\`\`\`python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
\`\`\`

\`\`\`typescript
interface Note {
  title: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
\`\`\`
```

### Tables

Create organized data with Markdown tables:

```markdown
| Feature | Lokus | Others |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Local-first | Yes | Varies |
| Privacy | Full | Limited |
| Speed | Fast | Slower |
```

## Performance

<Callout type="success">
**Lightning Fast**: Lokus v1.3.4 features intelligent caching that makes repeated operations instant!
</Callout>

You'll notice that after the first time you open the command palette or navigate through files, subsequent operations become instantaneous. This is thanks to an intelligent 5-minute TTL cache that eliminates redundant file system operations.

**Performance improvements**:
- Command Palette: Instant on repeated opens (was ~200-400ms)
- Split View: 50% faster
- Bases View: 90% faster on reopen
- Overall: 85-90% reduction in file system calls

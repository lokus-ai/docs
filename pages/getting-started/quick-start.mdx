# Quick Start

Get up and running with Lokus in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through the essential features to help you start taking notes effectively.

## First Launch

<Steps>

### Open Your First Workspace

When you first launch Lokus, you'll be prompted to open or create a workspace. A workspace is simply a folder on your computer where your notes will be stored.

1. Click **Open Workspace** or **Create New Workspace**
2. Select an empty folder or create a new one
3. Lokus will initialize the workspace and you're ready to start

<Callout type="info">
Your notes are stored as plain Markdown files on your local filesystem, giving you complete ownership and portability of your data.
</Callout>

### Interface Overview

The Lokus interface consists of four main areas:

- **Sidebar** (Left): Navigate your folder structure, search notes, and access recent files
- **Editor** (Center): Write and edit your notes with a clean, distraction-free interface
- **Preview** (Right, optional): See a live preview of your rendered Markdown
- **Top Bar**: Quick actions, workspace selector, and settings

</Steps>

## Creating Your First Note

<Steps>

### Create a New Note

There are several ways to create a new note:

- Click the **New Note** button in the toolbar
- Use the keyboard shortcut: `Cmd+N` (Mac) or `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux)
- Right-click in the sidebar and select **New Note**

Give your note a meaningful name like `my-first-note.md`.

### Basic Markdown Formatting

Lokus supports standard Markdown syntax. Here are the essentials:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text** and *italic text*

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
  - Nested bullet

1. Numbered list
2. Second item

> This is a blockquote

`inline code` and code blocks:

\`\`\`javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, Lokus!");
}
\`\`\`
```

### Wiki Links

One of Lokus's most powerful features is wiki-style linking between notes:

```markdown
Link to another note: [[Note Title]]

Link with custom text: [[Note Title|Custom Display Text]]

Link to a heading: [[Note Title#Heading]]
```

When you type `[[`, Lokus will show an autocomplete dropdown with your existing notes. If you link to a note that doesn't exist yet, Lokus will create it when you click the link.

</Steps>

## Advanced Features

### Math Equations

Lokus supports LaTeX math equations using KaTeX:

**Inline math**: Wrap expressions in single dollar signs

```markdown
The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
```

**Block math**: Use double dollar signs for display equations

```markdown
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$
```

<Callout type="info">
Math rendering happens in real-time as you type, making it perfect for technical notes and academic work.
</Callout>

### Task Lists

Create interactive checkboxes with task list syntax:

```markdown
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Another pending item
  - [ ] Nested subtask
```

Click any checkbox to toggle its completion state. Lokus saves the state automatically.

### Code Syntax Highlighting

Lokus provides syntax highlighting for numerous programming languages:

```markdown
\`\`\`python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
\`\`\`

\`\`\`typescript
interface Note {
  title: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
\`\`\`
```

### Tables

Create organized data with Markdown tables:

```markdown
| Feature | Lokus | Others |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Local-first | Yes | Varies |
| Privacy | Full | Limited |
| Speed | Fast | Slower |
```

- **Full-Text Search**: Press `Cmd+Shift+F` to search across all notes
- **Filter by tags**: Use `#tag` in search to find tagged notes

### Graph View

Visualize connections between your notes:

1. Click the **Graph View** icon in the toolbar
2. See an interactive network of your notes and their links
3. Click any node to open that note
4. Use the graph to discover relationships and gaps in your knowledge

### Templates

Save time with note templates:

1. Create a new note with your desired structure
2. Save it in a `.templates` folder in your workspace

# Workspace Setup

A workspace in Lokus is a folder on your computer that contains all your notes, attachments, and configuration. Understanding workspaces is key to organizing your knowledge effectively.

## What is a Workspace?

A workspace is simply a directory on your filesystem that Lokus uses to store your notes. Each workspace is completely independent, allowing you to:

- **Separate contexts**: Keep work notes separate from personal notes
- **Maintain privacy**: Store sensitive notes in encrypted volumes
- **Organize projects**: Create dedicated workspaces for different projects
- **Sync selectively**: Sync only specific workspaces to cloud storage

> **Note:** 
All notes are stored as plain Markdown (`.md`) files, making them portable and future-proof. You can open and edit them with any text editor.


### Workspace Structure

A typical workspace looks like this:

```
my-workspace/
├── .lokus/                 # Lokus configuration and metadata
│   ├── config.json        # Workspace settings
│   ├── graph.json         # Graph data cache
│   └── index.db           # Search index
├── .templates/            # Note templates
├── assets/                # Images and attachments
├── daily/                 # Daily notes
├── projects/              # Project notes
├── areas/                 # Areas of responsibility
└── resources/             # Reference materials
```

The `.lokus` folder contains workspace-specific settings and cached data. You can safely add it to `.gitignore` if versioning your notes.

## Creating a New Workspace

<Steps>

### Choose Your Location

Decide where to store your workspace:

- **Local storage**: `~/Documents/Lokus/` for general notes
- **Cloud sync**: `~/Dropbox/Notes/` or `~/iCloud/Notes/` for automatic backup
- **Encrypted volume**: For sensitive information
- **Git repository**: For version-controlled notes

### Create the Workspace

<Tabs items={['From Lokus', 'Manually']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    1. Click the workspace selector in the top bar
    2. Select **New Workspace**
    3. Choose a location and name
    4. Click **Create**

    Lokus will initialize the workspace with default folders and configuration.
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    1. Create a new folder in your preferred location
    2. Open Lokus and click **Open Workspace**
    3. Select the empty folder
    4. Lokus will initialize it as a workspace
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Initial Configuration

After creating a workspace, configure these essential settings:

1. **Workspace Name**: Give it a descriptive name in Settings → Workspace
2. **Default Folder**: Set where new notes are created by default
3. **Templates Location**: Specify where templates are stored (default: `.templates/`)
4. **Assets Location**: Choose where attachments are saved (default: `assets/`)

</Steps>

## Managing Multiple Workspaces

### Switching Workspaces

Lokus makes it easy to work with multiple workspaces:

- Click the **workspace selector** in the top bar
- Select from your recent workspaces
- Or choose **Open Workspace** to browse for a different one

> **Note:** 
Use keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Shift+O` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+O` (Windows/Linux) to quickly switch workspaces.


### Recent Workspaces

Lokus remembers your recently used workspaces:

- Access them from the workspace selector dropdown
- Pin frequently used workspaces to keep them at the top
- Remove workspaces from the list via right-click → **Remove from Recent**

> **Note:** 
Removing a workspace from recent workspaces does not delete any files. It only removes it from the quick access list.


### Workspace Session State

Lokus automatically saves your session state for each workspace:

- **Open files**: Your open tabs are restored when you return
- **Cursor position**: Resume exactly where you left off
- **Sidebar state**: Expanded folders and scroll position are preserved
- **Graph view state**: Your graph view position and zoom level

This makes it seamless to switch between different projects and contexts.

## Workspace Settings

### General Settings

Configure workspace-wide preferences in **Settings** → **Workspace**:

```json
{
  "name": "My Workspace",
  "defaultLocation": "inbox",
  "templatesFolder": ".templates",
  "attachmentsFolder": "assets",
  "autoSave": true,
  "autoSaveInterval": 2000
}
```

- **Name**: Display name for the workspace
- **Default Location**: Where new notes are created
- **Templates Folder**: Location of note templates
- **Attachments Folder**: Where pasted images and files are stored
- **Auto Save**: Enable automatic saving (recommended)
- **Auto Save Interval**: Delay in milliseconds before saving

### Editor Preferences

Each workspace can have unique editor preferences:

- **Font Family**: Different fonts for different contexts (e.g., monospace for code notes)
- **Font Size**: Adjust for different displays
- **Line Width**: Narrower for reading, wider for editing
- **Spell Check**: Enable for writing-focused workspaces

### File Handling

Configure how Lokus handles files in your workspace:

- **File Naming**: Choose between `kebab-case`, `snake_case`, or `Title Case`
- **New Note Template**: Default content for new notes
- **Confirm Delete**: Require confirmation before deleting notes
- **Trash Location**: Use system trash or workspace `.trash` folder

### Sync and Backup

Lokus works seamlessly with various sync solutions:

<Tabs items={['Dropbox', 'iCloud', 'Git', 'Syncthing']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Dropbox Sync**

    1. Create your workspace inside your Dropbox folder
    2. Dropbox automatically syncs changes across devices
    3. Access version history through Dropbox's web interface

    Recommended location: `~/Dropbox/Lokus/workspace-name/`
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    **iCloud Drive**

    1. Create workspace in `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/`
    2. iCloud syncs automatically on macOS and iOS
    3. Access notes on mobile devices with compatible apps

    Note: iCloud sync can be slower than Dropbox or Git
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Git Version Control**

    Initialize a Git repository in your workspace:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/workspace
    git init

    # Add .gitignore
    echo ".lokus/" >> .gitignore
    echo ".DS_Store" >> .gitignore

    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

    Benefits:
    - Full version history
    - Branch different versions of notes
    - Collaborate with others
    - Push to GitHub/GitLab for backup
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Syncthing**

    1. Set up Syncthing on your devices
    2. Add your workspace folder to Syncthing
    3. Configure sync settings:
       - Enable ignore patterns for `.lokus/` if needed
       - Use versioning for backup

    Syncthing provides local, peer-to-peer sync without cloud services.
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

> **Note:** 
**Conflict Resolution**: When syncing, be careful about editing the same note on multiple devices simultaneously. Most sync services create conflict files that you'll need to merge manually.


## File Organization Best Practices

### Folder Structure

Design a folder structure that matches how you think:

**Option 1: PARA Method**
```
workspace/
├── projects/        # Active projects with deadlines
├── areas/           # Ongoing responsibilities
├── resources/       # Reference materials
└── archives/        # Completed items
```

**Option 2: Zettelkasten**
```
workspace/
├── fleeting/        # Quick captures
├── literature/      # Notes from reading
├── permanent/       # Refined, atomic notes
└── index/           # Structure notes and maps
```

**Option 3: Simple Categories**
```
workspace/
├── work/
├── personal/
├── learning/
└── projects/
```

> **Note:** 
Choose a structure that feels natural to you. You can always reorganize later, and wiki links will remain intact even if you move files.


### Naming Conventions

Consistent naming makes notes easier to find:

**Date-based**: `2025-09-29-meeting-notes.md`
- Good for: Daily notes, meeting notes, journal entries
- Sorts chronologically
- Easy to find by date

**Descriptive titles**: `getting-started-with-react-hooks.md`
- Good for: Evergreen notes, tutorials, reference materials
- Searchable by content
- Easy to link with wiki links

**ID-based**: `202509291430-meeting-notes.md` (Zettelkasten style)
- Good for: Large collections of interconnected notes
- Unique identifiers prevent naming conflicts
- Timestamp preserves creation context

### Tags and Metadata

Use frontmatter to add metadata to your notes:

```markdown
---
title: Getting Started with Lokus
tags: [documentation, tutorial, beginner]
created: 2025-09-29
modified: 2025-09-29
author: Your Name
status: draft
---

# Note content starts here
```

Benefits of metadata:
- **Filter searches**: Find all notes with specific tags
- **Track status**: Know which notes are drafts, published, or archived
- **Sort by date**: See your most recent work
- **Add context**: Remember when and why you created a note

## Advanced Workspace Configuration

### Custom Configuration File

Advanced users can directly edit `.lokus/config.json`:

```json
{
  "workspace": {
    "name": "My Workspace",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "settings": {
      "defaultLocation": "inbox",
      "templatesFolder": ".templates",
      "attachmentsFolder": "assets",
      "dailyNotesFolder": "daily",
      "dailyNoteFormat": "YYYY-MM-DD"
    },
    "editor": {
      "fontFamily": "iA Writer Quattro",
      "fontSize": 16,
      "lineHeight": 1.6,
      "maxLineWidth": 750,
      "spellCheck": true,
      "typewriterMode": false,
      "focusMode": false
    },
    "behavior": {
      "autoSave": true,
      "autoSaveInterval": 2000,
      "confirmDelete": true,
      "openLinksInNewTab": false,
      "createNonExistentLinks": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Workspace Templates

Create a template workspace to quickly set up new projects:

1. Create a workspace with your ideal structure
2. Add template notes and folders
3. Configure settings
4. Save it as a template location
5. Copy this workspace whenever starting a new project

### Shared Workspaces

Collaborate with others using shared workspaces:

**Via Git:**
```bash
# Clone a shared repository
git clone https://github.com/team/shared-notes.git

# Open in Lokus
# Edit notes as usual
# Commit and push changes

git add .
git commit -m "Add meeting notes"
git push
```

**Via Network Drive:**
- Place workspace on a shared network drive
- Multiple users can access (avoid simultaneous edits)
- Use file locking if available

> **Note:** 
**Concurrent Editing**: Lokus is designed for single-user operation. Simultaneous editing by multiple users can cause conflicts. Use Git for version-controlled collaboration.


### Encrypted Workspaces

Protect sensitive notes with encryption:

**Option 1: System Encryption**
- macOS: Create an encrypted disk image with Disk Utility
- Windows: Use BitLocker or VeraCrypt
- Linux: Use LUKS encryption

**Option 2: Encrypted Container**
- Use VeraCrypt to create an encrypted container
- Mount the container when needed
- Open workspace inside mounted volume

**Option 3: Encrypted Cloud Storage**
- Use Cryptomator with Dropbox/iCloud
- Create workspace inside encrypted vault
- Automatic encryption on sync

## Troubleshooting

### Workspace Won't Open

If a workspace fails to open:

1. Check folder permissions (must be readable/writable)
2. Verify `.lokus` folder exists and isn't corrupted
3. Try opening from File menu instead of recent list
4. Check available disk space

### Missing Notes or Files

If notes are missing:

1. Verify you're in the correct workspace
2. Check the folder structure in Finder/Explorer
3. Use full-text search to locate the note
4. Check sync service for conflict files
5. Restore from backup if necessary

### Sync Conflicts

When sync services create conflicts:

1. Look for files named `file.md (conflicted copy)`
2. Open both versions side by side
3. Manually merge changes
4. Delete the conflict file after merging

### Performance Issues

If Lokus is slow with large workspaces:

1. Rebuild search index: Settings → Advanced → Rebuild Index
2. Exclude large folders from indexing
3. Archive old notes to a separate workspace
4. Check for very large individual files (>10MB)

## Next Steps

Now that you understand workspaces, explore these topics:

- [Markdown Reference](/guides/markdown) - Master Markdown syntax
- [Templates & Automation](/guides/templates) - Streamline your workflow
- [Graph View](/guides/graph-view) - Visualize your knowledge network
- [Keyboard Shortcuts](/guides/keyboard-shortcuts) - Work more efficiently

> **Note:** 
**Start with one workspace**: Don't over-complicate things initially. Most users find that one well-organized workspace is sufficient. Add more workspaces only when you have a clear need for separation.

### Calendar Integration

Calendar views for date properties, daily notes with calendar navigation, and timeline view for note chronology.

### Formula Support

Spreadsheet-like formulas in Bases with mathematical operations, property references, conditional logic, and auto-updating computed fields.

### PDF Annotations

## Planned

Scheduled for future releases.

### Obsidian Plugin Compatibility

Run Obsidian community plugins natively with a compatibility layer for plugin APIs. Gradual migration path while maintaining zero vendor lock-in.

### Multi-Vault Support

Manage multiple workspaces simultaneously with cross-vault search and linking, separate themes and plugins per vault.

### AI Writing Assistant

Integrated AI writing tools with grammar and style suggestions, content expansion and summarization, and research assistance with citations.

### Workflow Automation

Custom automation scripts with trigger-based actions, batch operations on notes, and scheduled tasks and reminders.

### Real-Time Collaboration

Multi-user editing with presence indicators, comments and annotations, and change tracking.

### End-to-End Encrypted Sync

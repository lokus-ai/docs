## Post 1: The Problem Statement

I spent 3 years jumping between Notion, Obsidian, and Roam Research.

Each one was missing something. Notion was too slow. Obsidian needed 10 plugins to be useful. Roam was... expensive.

So I built Lokus.

It's a local-first note-taking app that actually respects your workflow:
- Wiki-style linking that works
- Graph visualization that's actually useful (2D AND 3D)
- Canvas for visual thinkers
- A task manager that doesn't feel tacked on
- Everything stored as markdown on YOUR machine

No subscription. No cloud lock-in. Just your notes, your way.

Built with React and Rust. Open source. Cross-platform.

Check it out: github.com/lokus-ai/lokus

What's your current note-taking setup? Genuinely curious what people are using in 2025.

## Post 2: The Technical Flex

Hot take: Electron apps are bloated.

That's why I built Lokus with Tauri 2.0 instead.

Same React frontend you love. Rust backend for speed. But the app is ~10MB instead of ~100MB.

And it's FAST. Like, "wait, did that just happen?" fast.

Here's what I'm seeing:
- App launches in under 1 second
- Search across 10,000 notes in ~50ms
- Graph rendering handles 1000+ nodes smoothly
- Battery life that doesn't make you cry

The secret? No Chromium bloat. Just native webviews and Rust's zero-cost abstractions.

If you're building desktop apps in 2025 and still using Electron... maybe give Tauri a shot?

PS: Lokus is open source if you want to see how it's done.

## Post 3: The Feature Drop

Your notes deserve better than a text editor.

I just shipped Lokus v1.2 with some wild features:

üìä Bases - Turn your notes into Notion-style databases. Tables, cards, calendars. But local.

üìÆ Gmail Integration - Import emails as notes. Because sometimes your inbox IS your second brain.

üé® Canvas Mode - Whiteboard for ideas. Embed notes directly. Visual thinking ftw.

üîó Wiki Links - Type [[ and watch autocomplete magic happen. Backlinks included.

üìà Graph View - See your knowledge connections. In 3D. Because why not.

The best part? Everything's stored as markdown files. No proprietary format. No vendor lock-in.

Try it: github.com/lokus-ai/lokus

Built this because I was tired of subscription fatigue. Thought others might feel the same.

## Post 4: The Solo Developer Story

6 months ago I had an idea.
3 months ago I had a prototype.
Today Lokus has 500+ GitHub stars.

Building in public hits different.

Every week I shared what I was working on. The wins. The bugs. The 3am debugging sessions.

People started contributing. Reporting issues. Requesting features. Some even sent PRs.

This wasn't supposed to be a product. It was scratching my own itch - a note-taking app that actually worked the way I think.

Now developers are using it for documentation. Writers for their novels. Students for research.

The lesson? Ship it. Even if it's not perfect. Especially if it's not perfect.

Your "unfinished" project might be exactly what someone else needs.

## Post 5: The Privacy Angle

"Where are my notes stored?"
"What happens if your company shuts down?"
"Can you see my data?"

If you've asked these questions about Notion/Roam/etc... yeah, same.

That's why Lokus is local-first:
- Notes live on YOUR machine
- No servers. No cloud. No sync (yet).
- You own the data. Literally.

Want to backup? Copy the folder to Dropbox. Done.
Want to sync? Use iCloud/Syncthing/whatever. Your call.
Want to export? Already markdown files. Already done.

I'm not saying cloud sync is bad. It's coming to Lokus too.

But it should be OPTIONAL. Not mandatory.

Your thoughts shouldn't require WiFi.

## Post 6: The Dev Stack Deep Dive

Tech stack for Lokus (because people keep asking):

Frontend:
- React 19 (yeah, the new one)
- TipTap for editing (ProseMirror under the hood)
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite for builds

Backend:
- Rust + Tauri 2.0
- Tokio for async
- Serde for serialization

The cool stuff:
- Plugin system (like VS Code)
- MCP server for AI integration
- WebGL-accelerated graph rendering
- Sigma.js for network viz

Total bundle size? About 10MB.
Startup time? Under 1 second.
Lines of code? ~50k (and counting).

Open source: github.com/lokus-ai/lokus

Building desktop apps in 2025 is wild. Rust makes it fun.

## Post 7: The Comparison Post

Obsidian vs Notion vs Lokus

(From someone who's used all three extensively)

**Obsidian:**
‚úÖ Local files, fast, extensible
‚ùå Needs plugins for basic features
‚ùå Sync costs $10/month

**Notion:**
‚úÖ Beautiful UI, databases, collaboration
‚ùå Slow, proprietary format
‚ùå $10/month

**Lokus:**
‚úÖ Local files, fast, free
‚úÖ Databases built-in, no plugins needed
‚úÖ Open source, cross-platform
‚ùå No mobile apps (yet)
‚ùå No real-time collab (yet)

I'm biased obviously. But if you want local-first + powerful features without paying monthly... Lokus might be it.

What am I missing? What features would make you switch?

## Post 8: The Use Case Story

Met a PhD student yesterday using Lokus for their research.

They said: "I have 2,000 papers and 10,000 notes. Most tools choke. This doesn't."

That hit different.

I built Lokus thinking developers would use it for docs. Turns out:
- Researchers are using it for literature reviews
- Writers for novel outlines (with the canvas feature)
- Students for exam prep (the graph view is üî•)
- Developers for... yeah, docs

The graph visualization shows connections between concepts. The search is instant. The wiki links make everything feel connected.

One user told me they finally understand their thesis topic after seeing it visualized.

That's the stuff that makes building in public worth it.

If you're drowning in notes/papers/research... maybe give it a shot?

## Post 9: The Feature Request Thread

Building Lokus in public means people request wild features.

Some requests I got this week:

"Can it integrate with my email?" ‚Üí Shipped Gmail integration
"What about collaboration?" ‚Üí On the roadmap
"Mobile app?" ‚Üí Working on it
"Can I use it offline?" ‚Üí Already works offline, it's local-first
"Vim keybindings?" ‚Üí Plugin system supports it

The one that surprised me: "Can I use it as a CRM?"

Yes. Someone is using Lokus as a CRM. With the database views (Bases) feature.

I love when people use tools in unexpected ways.

What would YOU want in a note-taking app? Drop it below. Might just build it.

## Post 10: The Why This Matters Post

2025 prediction: People will care more about data ownership.

Not because of privacy scandals (though those help).

But because they're tired of:
- Losing access when subscriptions lapse
- Features being removed arbitrarily
- Companies pivoting and shutting down services
- Data being held hostage in proprietary formats

Lokus is my bet on that future:
- Local-first architecture
- Open file formats (markdown)
- Open source code
- No subscription required

Can you still use cloud sync? Sure, if you want.
Can you export your data? It's already in markdown.
Can you trust the company won't shut down? There is no company. It's just code.

This isn't about being anti-cloud. It's about having options.

Your digital brain shouldn't depend on a startup's runway.

Thoughts? Am I being too paranoid or not paranoid enough?

## Bonus Post 11: The Technical Challenge

Hardest problem building Lokus wasn't the UI.

It was the graph rendering.

10,000+ notes with bidirectional links = complex network graph.

Initial approach: D3-force in React. Laggy mess. 200+ nodes and it crawled.

Solution:
- Moved to WebGL with Sigma.js
- Web Worker for layout calculations
- Memory pooling to avoid GC pauses
- Viewport culling for large graphs

Now it handles 1000+ nodes smoothly. 60fps. Zoomable. Beautiful.

The lesson? Sometimes the right architecture is more important than clever code.

Also: Don't be afraid to throw away weeks of work when you find a better approach.

For those curious about the implementation:

Performance engineering is underrated.

## Bonus Post 12: The Launch Day Post

After 6 months of nights and weekends...

Lokus v1.0 is live. üöÄ

It's a note-taking app that doesn't suck:
- Local-first (your data, your machine)
- Markdown-based (no lock-in)
- Wiki links + graph visualization
- Task management + kanban boards
- Database views (like Notion)
- Canvas for visual thinking
- Built with React + Rust

Free. Open source. Cross-platform.

I built this because I was frustrated with existing tools. Maybe you are too.

Try it: github.com/lokus-ai/lokus
Docs: [your docs link]

Feedback, bug reports, feature requests - all welcome.

Let's build the note-taking app we all wish existed.
